Cheese's middle name?"</p><p>After looking at the three options, Jenna answered correctly with "Entertainment."</p><p>When Jenna got the answer correct, Hoda picked up the spray cheese, took the cap off, and shook it.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>"No no no!" Jenna screamed. "No no no!"</p><p>"No, you won, so yay!" Hoda said, as she aimed the bottle toward Jenna.</p><p>"That doesn't mean you spray me with Cheez Whiz," Jenna laughed, as she stuck her hands up.</p><p>Hoda put the can down and asked what Jenna won, which was a box of Ritz Crackers.</p><p>But, after she received her prize, Hoda picked it back up again.</p><p>The <a href=#>Today</a> host sprayed some on her finger, but it wound up spraying and hitting Jenna and the floor.</p><p>The crew yelled and laughed off-camera and the women made disgusted faces.</p><h2>WOAH, MAMA!</h2><p>The women often get into shenanigans when they are on-air together.</p><p>Just one day before, Hoda and Jenna participated in a workout segment with Peloton trainer Ally Love.</p><p>During the segment, Ally discussed "small moves" that could have a big impact on your overall fitness journey.</p><p>After Ally finished demonstrating one of the moves, Jenna went to try to perform one on her own.</p><p>However, Hoda tried to quietly warn Jenna that she "shouldn't be doing" the workout because <a href=#>she "had nothing on."</a></p><p>The comment was made very quickly and in a hushed manner but was still audible as Hoda tried not to make a big deal of the situation.</p><p>Jenna could be heard saying, "Hey, hey" in response to Hoda, trying to keep things under wraps.</p><p>She had on a short black dress that just resembled a blazer and long, knee-high boots.</p><p>Meanwhile, Hoda had on pants, a shirt, a sweater and boots.</p><h2>EW!</h2><p>On Wednesday's show, the fans slammed the women for the "disgusting habit" they share with their intimate partners.</p><p>Hoda and Jenna revealed that they would <a href=#>let their partners use their toothbrushes</a> and found nothing wrong with it.</p><p>They discussed a story that went viral.</p><p>"So, this was a husband. He was outraged after he found out that his wife had been using his toothbrush," Jenna explained.</p><p>"She says that she just uses it from time to time," Hoda chimed in. "Don't get all bent out of shape. She doesn't use it daily."</p><p>"And sometimes it can be by accident," Jenna said.</p><p>"Maybe you confuse the brushes."</p><p>"Especially on a trip," Hoda said. "Because you bring one of those travel brushes and you're like, 'Is that yours?'"</p><p>"He says it's quote 'revoluting.' Revoluting, he described her toothbrush as, because he doesn't want to rub her plaque on his teeth," Hoda said.</p><p>Jenna spoke up and said: "She says it's not different than kissing. I was gonna say, I can tell you a way you rub plaque against somebody's teeth. Teeth to teeth."</p><p>"Yeah. Making out," Hoda said, before questioning her co-host's words. "Teeth to teeth? God, who are you kissing?"</p><p>"You know what I meant, mouth to mouth," Jenna defended herself.</p><p>"Teeth to teeth is like when you don't know how to kiss and you bang your teeth together," Hoda said.</p><h2>THEIR TAKE</h2><p>"Ok, so this is how we feel about it," Hoda admitted.</p><p>"We, collectively, think sharing a toothbrush is no big deal."</p><p>Jenna added that she "didn't care."</p><p>The&nbsp;Today&nbsp;host also added that it surprised her that Hoda would say that because she feels like she has been "gaslit."</p><p>"You said it was no big deal-."</p><p>"No big deal if you want to share your toothbrush with a husband or boyfriend," Hoda corrected.</p><p>"Am I not-?" Jenna asked.</p><p>"You're an intimate partner," Hoda said, laughing.</p><p>Jenna then went on to tell a story about the two of them eating something that got all over their teeth.</p><p>She said her teeth were orange when they were done.</p><p>Hoda explained that she had a toothbrush in her bag and brushed her teeth.</p><p>Jenna asked if she could use Hoda's toothbrush and she told Jenna that she could take some toothpaste, put it on her finger, and clean her teeth like that.</p><p>"That's what confuses me," Jenna said. "You said it was no big deal."</p><p>"No big deal if you don't have Cheetos or Doritos in your teeth," Hoda said.</p><p>"That's kind of icky. That's a bridge too far."</p><p>The women also shared that they have used each other's deodorant before.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Jenna admitted that her husband doesn't like them sharing toothbrushes, but she sneaks it sometimes and uses his razors. as well.</p><p>"I can't," Hoda ended the segment.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/01/today-crew-shocked-hoda-kotb-790374560.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/01/today-crew-shocked-hoda-kotb-790374555.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/01/today-crew-shocked-hoda-kotb-790374561.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hvYW6Dd4GYaKuonJGueqm7w5pkpKekl3q0vNGasKxlmpq7r62Mm6ysoF2drqix0WaaoZ2Vr3q4tMizZg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-pia-toscano-dating.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Pia Toscano Dating Now</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./oscar-wylde.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Oscar Wylde</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-offensive-t-shirts-that-have-been-removed-from-stores.html>15 Most Offensive T-Shirts Ever</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./extreme-makeover-jillian-harris-edition.html>Extreme Makeover: Jillian Harris Edition!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lizzy-mcalpine-tour-2022-how-buy-tickets.html>Lizzy McAlpine tour 2022: How can I buy tickets?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nichole-lynel.html>Nichole Lynel</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./teddy-afro.html>Teddy Afro</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 LoopBlog.
