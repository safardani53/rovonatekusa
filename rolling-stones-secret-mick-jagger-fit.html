He is a fitness man, you know. His father was a PE instructor.”</p><p>The affable Ronnie Wood, whose infectious good humour helps glue the Stones together, shared this insight: “If you let anything stand for long, it will go sour.</p><p>“Look at Mick, he doesn’t let things stand. He’s always working out. I don’t exactly know how he does it but he certainly keeps doing it.”</p><p>And Richards quipped: “Well, I lend him some energy and I think Ronnie lends him some, too. So far as I know, he doesn’t feel any pain!”</p><p>If stories of rock ’n’ roll excess surrounded the early careers of Jagger, Richards and Wood, I can confirm that Mick’s body is a temple these days.</p><p>He keeps his voice in great shape, beginning his vocal exercises at least two months before every Stones tour begins.</p><p>I guess Jagger’s life less ordinary can be compared to a thoroughbred racehorse that has stayed the distance.</p><p>It has involved a trail of beautiful women, a few headline-grabbing controversies...and countless classic songs written with Richards.</p><p>His list of partners reads like a geography lesson.</p><p>It includes Sixties siren Marianne Faithfull, American singer Marsha Hunt, his Nicaraguan wife Bianca (the only one he married), Texan model Jerry Hall (mum to four of his eight kids), Italian singer/model <a href=#>Carla Bruni</a>, Brazilian model Luciana Giminez and fashion designer L’Wren Scott, another American.</p><p>Let’s not forget, too, that Jagger is a father, grandfather, great-grandfather, style icon, film-maker, astute self-taught businessman and cricket lover who will be gripped by the Ashes as I write.</p><h2>Style icon</h2><p>On the personal front, he remains very close to his choreographer and former ballerina girlfriend Melanie Hamrick, mother of the youngest of his children, six-year-old Deveraux.</p><p>However, a friend of the singer tells me that recent reports of their engagement to be married are unfounded.</p><p>That said, 2023 is shaping up to be another momentous year for rock’s most enduring frontman because the Stones’ first album of original material since 2005’s A Bigger Bang is due in October.</p><p>Delayed by the Covid pandemic and the <a href=#>devastating loss of Watts</a>, the buzz around the new songs is already building to a deafening roar.</p><p>But to get inside this ever-fascinating character, we must go back in time again to 1961, two years after his televised rock climbing antics.</p><p>As commemorated by a blue plaque, he bumped into Richards on Platform 2 of Dartford Station and they instantly bonded over their shared love of the blues, notably Chuck Berry and Muddy Waters.</p><p>Cue the birth of the <a href=#>Rolling Stones</a>, the sleazy, sexy, dangerous alternative to the clean-cut Beatles.</p><p>In his early days as a performer, Jagger looked to <a href=#>America</a> for inspiration and two great showmen were his guiding lights.</p><p>From rock ’n’ roll came <a href=#>Little Richard</a> and from soul, James Brown.</p><p>I spoke to Jagger in 2014 to mark his production company’s biopic about Brown’s troubled life AND artistic brilliance.</p><p>“I went to see him over and over and I tried some of his moves,” he said, recalling his impressionable early Sixties self.</p><p>“I did some very bad imitations but they were fun.”</p><h2>'Evolved your own style'</h2><p>Then, he added: “We also did a tour with Little Richard, who was very generous in explaining to me how to deal with an audience.</p><p>“You’re in this phase of your career when you’re 19 or 20 and you’re basically doing cover versions and copying other people.</p><p>“Everybody did it and, if you got any good, you evolved your own style.”</p><p>That, of course, is exactly what Jagger did, although another hugely important influence was the Queen of Rock ’n’ Roll, the late, great Tina Turner.</p><p>Ike and Tina were invited to support the Stones on their 1966 UK tour.</p><p>She struck up a friendship with Mick, calling him “the little boy from Dartford”.</p><p>He would watch her from the side of the stage and soon they were trading dance moves.</p><p>Jagger told me the secret of his stage craft: “It’s all about working audiences and never giving up.</p><p>“Don’t overdo it. Don’t harangue them. Just get them involved.”</p><p>In the mid-Sixties, the Stones released a string of Jagger/Richards-penned hits which made them the closest rivals to <a href=#>The Beatles</a>.</p><p>These included the adrenalin rush of Paint It Black, the immortal hook of Satisfaction and the rebel yell of Get Off Of My Cloud.</p><p>Then the intuitive songwriting partnership hit overdrive with a string of consecutive classic albums, Beggar’s Banquet (1968), Let It Bleed (1969), Sticky Fingers (1971) and Exile On Main St. (1972).</p><h2>Tantalising prospect</h2><p>These yielded Sympathy For The Devil, Street Fighting Man, Midnight Rambler, Brown Sugar, Wild Horses, Tumbling Dice and more classics.</p><p>Worth noting here...we know Jagger is a consummate singer and showman but he’s also a fabulous harmonica player and a fine lyricist.</p><p>He’s particularly proud of yearning You Can’t Always Get What You Want, with its unforgettable opening lines, “I saw her today at the reception/A glass Of wine in her hand”.</p><p>And, I’m told, the final song on Sticky Fingers, Moonlight Mile, a raw ballad about his <a href=#>drug-fuelled life</a> on tour in the late Sixties.</p><p>It begins: “When the wind blows and the rain feels cold/With a head full of snow, with a head full of snow.”</p><p>As Jagger’s career with the Stones progressed, including welcoming Ronnie Wood into the fold in 1976 and releasing 1978’s sleazy tour de force Some Girls, there were inevitable strains in his relationship with Richards.</p><p>The cooling off came to a head in 1986 when, following the poorly- received Dirty Work album, both pursued solo projects and we saw Jagger preferring to be Dancing In The Street with <a href=#>David Bowie</a>.</p><p>Richards reflected on this period in one of my chats with him: “Mick and I had been joined at the hip for more than 20 years and we both thought, ‘Let’s go off and do what we want amongst ourselves’.”</p><p>But when he took to the stage as the singer and guitarist in his band The X-pensive Winos, his regard for Jagger soared.</p><p>“I thought, ‘Wow!’” he said. “Suddenly I had a whole new appreciation of Mick.</p><p>“It’s non-stop if you’re at the front, whereas with the Stones, I could discreetly pull back and hang with Charlie.</p><p>“There’s no leeway when you’re the frontman and that took some learning. Well, there it is, I’m saying it, ‘Hats off to Mick!’”</p><h2>'Great vibe'</h2><p>When the Stones reconvened for 1989’s Steel Wheels, “there was such a great vibe”, remembers Richards.</p><p>“Because me and Mick had taken a break, we came back to each other with a certain new respect.</p><p>“Maybe we realised how much we needed each other.”</p><p>He added: “I can praise Charlie 100 per cent of the time and I can praise Mick 99.9 per cent of the time.</p><p>“Mick knows what I mean and he’ll say the same about me. Things happen between us because it’s just two guys working together.</p><p>“You only hear of the odd bust-up. I love the man.”</p><p>Since the turn of the millennium, the Stones juggernaut has swung into action every few years for tours across the globe and just a couple of studio albums.</p><p>Now we have the tantalising prospect of new original music.</p><p>But for Jagger, Richards and Wood, the loss of drummer <a href=#>Watts</a> in 2021 hit hard.</p><p>In paying tribute, Mick described Charlie’s impeccable drumming and also their close relationship.</p><p>“We had a lot of wonderful times apart from playing music together. We used to go and watch cricket,” he said.</p><p>“When we’d get together, we didn’t talk about music. We talked about art, and he knew a lot more about it than I did.”</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>But I’ll leave you with a quote from <a href=#>Alice Cooper</a>, who told me: “Jagger is the prototype, the Energizer bunny who goes on for ever.</p><p>“We all look up to Mick and we’ve all taken a little bit from him.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/british-musician-mick-jagger-rolling-832995619.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/mick-jagger-rolling-stones-rolling-832999661.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/b2f77af9-b256-4c78-a294-60e117baae8f.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/tp-composite-more-mick.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hwZmqGeXyXaKmopJyeu6h50q2mp52jYsCmr9Geq2almZi4brbAoJ6eql2btrV7</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./teedra-moses.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Teedra Moses</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./meng-er-zhang.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Fame | Meng'er Zhang net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-offensive-t-shirts-that-have-been-removed-from-stores.html>15 Most Offensive T-Shirts Ever</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./extreme-makeover-jillian-harris-edition.html>Extreme Makeover: Jillian Harris Edition!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lizzy-mcalpine-tour-2022-how-buy-tickets.html>Lizzy McAlpine tour 2022: How can I buy tickets?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nichole-lynel.html>Nichole Lynel</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./teddy-afro.html>Teddy Afro</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 LoopBlog.
