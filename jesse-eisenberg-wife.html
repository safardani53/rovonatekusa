She was also a producer on a short film titled Light on a Path, Follow.</p><p>Although Anna's work in Hollywood has decreased over the years, there's an important reason why.

Jesse recounted a story of how he met his Fleishman Is in Trouble co-star Claire Danes 15 years ago at a party, but failed to realize the woman he was talking to was Claire Danes.</p><p>Jesse had been separated from Anna that night. When he reunited with Anna, he said, "Honey, I think I just met my soulmate. I met this amazing woman." Anna quipped, "That's Claire Danes, you idiot. Good luck.'"</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>Jesse also revealed on Late Night With Seth Meyers that he pursued Anna for about a year and a half before she actually agreed to date him.</p><p>He joked, "I went through the 12 stages of Hercules before I could get her to date me." We love a woman that knows her worth!</p><p>Thankfully it worked out in the end for Fleishman Is in Trouble star Jesse and his amazing activist wife Anna.
