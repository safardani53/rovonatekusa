Since then, the inventor has been constantly slammed on Twitter, and he has been called out for being an ableist as people strive to cancel him.</p><p>The Swedish YouTuber is one of the most popular video makers on the platform. In his most recent video, titled – My Dog Cringes at TikToks, the 32-year-old responds to videos that make him “cringe” alongside his dog, Maya. PewDiePie responds to TikTok founder Scarlet May’s video in one of the numerous videos. The 21-year-old influencer can be seen in the video narrating a hilarious interaction at a fast food drive-thru. She is shown explaining the incident with her long silver acrylic nails while using sign language.</p><p>The YouTuber stops the video short while viewing it and says:</p><p>“I’m not paying attention. Maya, look at her wild nails!”</p><p>He then holds his dog’s paws with both hands and waves them around, clearly mocking the TikToker’s American sign language. He also says:</p><p>“Sorry, are my nails bothering you?”</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Not Pewdiepie making fun of a deaf woman??? <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/sugizTcosx</a></p><p>— 𝑰𝒄𝒆𝒅 (@Iced_Exponet) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">July 27, 2022</a></p><p>Needless to say, PewDiePie has faced widespread criticism for the video and has subsequently deleted the tape showing him responding to Scarlet May. He also attempted to conceal his misconduct, but his fans had already screen-recorded the footage and shared it on social media networks.</p><h2>Who is Scarlet May? TikTok Creator reacts to PewDiePie’s latest video</h2><p>Scarlet May, who was born on January 6, 2001, is a 21-year-old TikTok creator with over 6.2 million followers. Her fans like her “story time” videos, which often include her intricate manicures. TikToker is well recognized for uploading films in both spoken English and American sign language.&nbsp;In early 2020, the Rockford, Illinois native opened her account. Performing the Renegade dance to K Camp’s Lottery is one of her most popular videos. Her Deaf Kardashians series also helped her garner a lot of popularity on her Instagram.</p><p>May’s video became popular when PewDiePie’s response to her TikTok video went viral. She also addressed the footage in a TikTok video on Wednesday, captioning it:</p><p>“I hope he learns from this since we all make errors.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Scarlet-May-1.jpg alt="Scarlet May" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>She addressed the questions that people had probably been asking her throughout the video. She mentioned:</p><p>“How am I feeling? I thought it was strange and needless, but I’m not shocked since I’m accustomed to it. It’s been a major problem in the deaf world that I’ve been attempting to normalize and bring to light: using nails while signing is normal and acceptable. But then a major creative comes on here and throws us back a million steps, which is incredibly aggravating.”</p><p>The 21-year-old further said that if someone had narrated the tale with long nails without needing to sign, they would not have been mocked, and went on to say:</p><p>“But since I have long nails and had to sign to communicate, he stopped the video after two seconds and didn’t even listen to the tale, and then continued to make fun of me with his dog.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Scarlet-May-2.jpg alt="Scarlet May" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>May also addressed the YouTuber directly, stating that he does not have the right to “simply insult deaf individuals who have been battling for years.”</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGinnq%2BUnrKxtcRmoKxllpawqrrGZpmam5uhrrS0jJqdrZ2iYrWmecyam55lmJ7Abr7Eppiro12Wr7DB02aqnJmiobK1ecyasGg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./sage-brocklebank-19780114-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Sage Brocklebank (TV Actor) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./peoples-sexiest-men-alive-share-the-most-memorable-pickup-lines-theyve-ever-heard.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>PEOPLE's Sexiest Men Alive Share the Most Memorable Pickup Lines They've Ever Heard</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-offensive-t-shirts-that-have-been-removed-from-stores.html>15 Most Offensive T-Shirts Ever</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./extreme-makeover-jillian-harris-edition.html>Extreme Makeover: Jillian Harris Edition!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lizzy-mcalpine-tour-2022-how-buy-tickets.html>Lizzy McAlpine tour 2022: How can I buy tickets?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nichole-lynel.html>Nichole Lynel</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./teddy-afro.html>Teddy Afro</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 LoopBlog.
