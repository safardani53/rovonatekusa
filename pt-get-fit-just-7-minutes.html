Return to the middle and then continue to swap sides for the full minute.</p><p>This might feel like a strange exercise, but Lucy said it will help tone the muscles that run down the side of your waist and will also help stabilise your muscles.</p><p>For minute three you're doing lunge kicks.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">The seven minute seated workout</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>If you are less able and need to do a seated workout - then Lucy also has you covered.</p><p><strong>Minute one: </strong>Seated punches. Sit up tall with your arms out in front of you, punch each arm out.</p><p><strong>Minute two: </strong>Tummy twist. With your hands on your temples, and sitting up straight - slowly twist left to right.</p><p><strong>Minute three:</strong> Swimmers. For this stretch both arms out in front of you as if you're going to do the breaststroke. Pull your arms back into a circular motion and then repeat.</p><p><strong>Minute four:</strong> Power kicks. Kick your right leg, while punching the left arm. Alternate for one minute.</p><p><strong>Minute five:</strong> Crunch and twist. Put your hands to your head and bring your right knee up, angling your left elbow down. Alternate and continue for the full 60 seconds.</p><p><strong>Minute six:</strong> Thumbs up. Again with a straight back, bring both arms out in front of you, with your thumbs up open your arms out and bring them back to centre.</p><p><strong>Minute seven: </strong>Cupids arrow. Get into a position as though you are using a bow and arrow. Right arm extended and left pulled in. Alternate the arm you pull in for 60 seconds.</p><p>Position your feet like you are on a train track, so not directly behind each other. Lunge down on one leg and then kick up with the opposite leg.</p><p>Keep repeating for a minute, changing legs each time.</p><p>Next up is speed skaters and for this you should swing your right leg behind you, also bringing your right arm forward while the left goes behind you to stabilise you.</p><p>Repeat on the left leg and continue to alternate for one minute.</p><p>Minute five is a side shuffle and you need to start in a squat position.</p><p>Shuffle a couple of paces to the right, before doing the same on the left - maintaining your squat position - continue with this until the 60 seconds is up.</p><p>Next is the punch and crunch. Standing, punch out with your left hand, then your right hand.</p><p>Next bring your left knee to your chest, then your right, continue this pattern for one minute.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The Sun">Read More on The Sun</h2><p>Finally for minute seven, take a step in and out.</p><p>Stand with your arms by your side, step you right foot out and then your left, lifting your arms up high each time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57x56YpayYZIJ5g5hsZ3FnoKl6qLHTZp2irF2fwrTAjHBkpqGeqsGmv44%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./fokue7ex8fbzx49fjd7slgo4ldfbmt9l.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Watch Party Down South Season 5 Episode 2: Lyle's Achy-Breaky Heart</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./henry-lewis.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Henry Lewis</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-offensive-t-shirts-that-have-been-removed-from-stores.html>15 Most Offensive T-Shirts Ever</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./extreme-makeover-jillian-harris-edition.html>Extreme Makeover: Jillian Harris Edition!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lizzy-mcalpine-tour-2022-how-buy-tickets.html>Lizzy McAlpine tour 2022: How can I buy tickets?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nichole-lynel.html>Nichole Lynel</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./teddy-afro.html>Teddy Afro</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 LoopBlog.
