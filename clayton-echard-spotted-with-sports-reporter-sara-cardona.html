The duo separately shared photos from the event via their Instagram Stories on Sunday, February 5.</p><p>The Missouri native, for his part, reposted a video of himself dancing in the stands while Cardona stood by his side. “The liquid courage had taken over by this point 👀😂,” he quipped in his caption.</p><p>Cardona is based in the Lexington area, joining the local network ABC36 as a sports anchor in November 2021. Born in Colombia, she grew up in Nashville and later covered teams in Gainesville, Florida, and Murfreesboro, Tennessee.</p><p>Before he was spotted with Cardona, Echard was most recently in a relationship with <a href=#><strong>Susie Evans</strong></a>, who won his season of <a href=#>The Bachelor</a>. The sales rep proposed to the wedding photographer, 29, during the March 2022 season finale, but she turned him down. During the After the Final Rose special, however, Evans revealed that the pair rekindled their romance after filming.</p><p>The pair ultimately <a href=#>called it quits in September 2022</a>, six months after the finale aired on ABC. “With incredibly heavy hearts, we wanted to share that we have decided to go our separate ways. For anyone who has ever loved, knows this was a painful decision to make and not one taken lightly,” the duo said in a joint statement at the time. “We understand that there will likely be a lot of questions about this decision — social media is definitely a highlight reel and much of our experiences together we have kept private as I’m sure most can understand. But we will share this — although this last year together has brought us so much joy and so many laughs, there has also been a significant amount of pain.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/The-Bachelor-Clayton-Echard-Spotted-With-Sports-Reporter-Sara-Cardona-After-Susie-Evans-Split-2.jpg><p>Earlier this month, Echard sparked romance rumors with ex <a href=#><strong>Rachel Recchia</strong></a>, who was one of the three finalists on his Bachelor season alongside Evans and <a href=#><strong>Gabby Windey</strong></a>. The pilot, 26, and the <a href=#>Dancing With the Stars</a> alum, 32, self-eliminated after Echard confessed that he was in love with both of them. Recchia and Windey went on to become co-leads of <a href=#>The Bachelorette</a> season 19.</p><p>Despite their split, Recchia and Echard <a href=#>recently reunited for a series of cheeky TikTok videos</a> recorded with other <a href=#>Bachelor Nation</a> members. In one clip, season 18 Bachelorette <a href=#><strong>Michelle Young</strong></a> lip-synching over someone saying, “Are you gonna tell me what’s going on?”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The camera then cut to Recchia, who mouthed the words: “I would, but I think explaining it might give us both an aneurysm.” At that point, the camera pulled back to reveal the season 19 Bachelorette sitting next to the former NFL player.</p><p>Days later, the Chicago native <a href=#>seemingly reacted to the speculation</a> about her and Echard in an Instagram Story post. “U guys have me dedd [sic] it’s all in good fun,” she wrote on Friday, February 3, alongside a selfie taken in a car. “Healing and forgiveness is a lesson I had trouble learning for a long time. I promise I’m not leaving this era quite yet.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGacpJGuwbC6jJ6aoZmimXq0vM6tq56cXay2tbSMrKeoqqSoerOxz6iprZ2iYsCivsBmmpqqlKS7ons%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./taylor-swift-night-on-dancing-with-the-stars-everything-we-know-5192596.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Everything We Know Hollywood Life</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./snooki-store-new-jersey-stop-looting-photo.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Snooki Claps Back At Claim She Let People In Her Store To Stop Looting Hollywood Life</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-offensive-t-shirts-that-have-been-removed-from-stores.html>15 Most Offensive T-Shirts Ever</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./extreme-makeover-jillian-harris-edition.html>Extreme Makeover: Jillian Harris Edition!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lizzy-mcalpine-tour-2022-how-buy-tickets.html>Lizzy McAlpine tour 2022: How can I buy tickets?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nichole-lynel.html>Nichole Lynel</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./teddy-afro.html>Teddy Afro</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 LoopBlog.
