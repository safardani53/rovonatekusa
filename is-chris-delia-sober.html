Although the comedian impersonates drunk people constantly, he's been sober for most of his life, due to lack of interest.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>It's incredibly common to see comedians drinking on stage during their sets, whether it's to loosen up while performing in front of their massive audiences, to have something to hold aside from a microphone, or to simply enjoy a drink alongside their many fans. But one comedian you'll never see sipping an alcoholic beverage is Chris D'Elia. Shocking, right?</p><p>Although Chris happens to do <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an impeccable impersonation of drunk people</a>, the comedian has apparently abstained from alcohol for most of his life — stay tuned for more on <a href=#>why Chris D'Elia is sober</a>.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why has Chris D'Elia always chosen to stay sober?</h2><p>While a number of comedians abstain from alcohol because they drank too much in their youth, such as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">John Mulaney</a> or <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Russell Brand</a>, Chris is an anomaly — he never drank much alcohol to begin with. In <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a Reddit AMA</a>, in which fans asked the comedian all kinds of questions, someone inquired about his sobriety, and he basically explained that he was never interested in drinking, unlike his sober comedian counterparts.&nbsp;</p><p>"I never really 'decided' it so to speak. I just never have done drugs or drank. Very odd I know. Just never have. Don't really know why haha," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the comedian responded</a> in the AMA... so that basically explains it.</p><p>Because of Chris' goofy demeanor, however, fans often accuse him of being intoxicated during his performances, and unsurprisingly, he often tells them off, like in the thread below.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>No. I don't drink. <a href=#>https://t.co/jGK5cTSZrp</a></p>— Chris D'Elia (@chrisdelia) <a href=#>December 3, 2016</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Chris just dropped a new Netflix stand-up special called 'No Pain' about his unusually "easy" childhood.</h2><p>Also unlike many fellow comedians who had tough upbringings, Chris had a relatively easy childhood, which he discusses in his new Netflix stand-up special, No Pain. While many comedians attribute their sense of humor to childhood trauma, like Tiffany Haddish, who <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">spent time in foster care</a>, or <a href=#>Richard Pryor</a>, who was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">abandoned by his own mother</a>, Chris said he feels bad about having such an uncomplicated upbringing.</p><p>In an interview with Decider, prior to dropping the new Netflix special, Chris explained <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">why his boring childhood</a> didn't get in the way of making his audiences laugh — he still had ample material to work with.</p><p>“Coming up as a comedian, I would feel insecure that I didn’t have that story, that I just had parents that were together, and how they’re still together... &nbsp;just because I wasn’t, you know, going through hardship doesn’t mean I can’t be funny. That’s the dumbest thing I ever heard," he said.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p><a href=#>via GIPHY</a></p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: GIPH</a></figure><p>Chris' abstinence from alcohol can't be attributed to life-altering "teachable" moment, or to having a history of alcoholism in his family — he was simply never interested in consuming liquor, which is completely acceptable. And evidently, without alcohol or a hard childhood, he's still managed to succeed in the dark world of comedy. Needless to say, we're excited to see some hilarious bits in No Pain.</p><p>Catch Chris' latest standup special, No Pain, on Netflix as of Tuesday, April 14.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsBur8eroKxllJq5qq2MrKabnaI%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./dori-monson.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Fame | Dori Monson net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./90-day-fiance-the-other-way-daniele-shares-intimacy-secrets-yohan-exclusive.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>90 Day Finac's Daniele Shares the Secret to Intimacy with Tall Yohan</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-offensive-t-shirts-that-have-been-removed-from-stores.html>15 Most Offensive T-Shirts Ever</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./extreme-makeover-jillian-harris-edition.html>Extreme Makeover: Jillian Harris Edition!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lizzy-mcalpine-tour-2022-how-buy-tickets.html>Lizzy McAlpine tour 2022: How can I buy tickets?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nichole-lynel.html>Nichole Lynel</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./teddy-afro.html>Teddy Afro</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 LoopBlog.
