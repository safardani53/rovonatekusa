through.</p><p>Simon Barney, the father of three of her children, has grim news: He has Stage 3 throat cancer.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg></p><p>“I’m a private person, despite what my time on reality television might say,” Simon Barney tells <a href=#>People</a> in a grave new interview.</p><p>“But I wanted to speak before someone else does and uses their words, not mine,” he explains.</p><p>“And to speak out about it,” Simon shares, “so others can see how I’ve taken this fight on with optimism.”</p><p>He adds: “and the good this has ultimately brought my life.” Simon is referring to his diagnosis of Stage 3 throat cancer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>“I think everything happens for a reason, I think your destiny is pretty much set for you, and you’re here to learn lessons,” Simon opines.</p><p>“This has been a tough lesson for me,” the father of three admits. “And I’m hoping it can be a lesson for others, too.”</p><p>It turns out that Simon first began to notice symptoms in May of 2019. At the time, his salivary glands were swollen on one side.</p><p>Doctors initially assumed that it was an infection. Unfortunately, an ultrasound and biopsy found other impacted areas, including the side of his neck.</p><p>The diagnosis ended up being cancer. It had spread to his throat, to his tonsils, and to his lymph nodes.</p><p>He did not begin telling most people about his diagnosis until last month, when his treatments began.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Surgery was not a viable option, which means a brutal regimen of radiation and chemotherapy — in conjunction with each other.</p><p>Simon has chemo every three weeks and undergoes radiation every single day — five days a week — for seven weeks.</p><p>Obviously, Simon didn’t wait to tell everyone. He told his fiancee of many years, Catushia Ienni (below).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>He also told his ex, Tamra Judge, and their three children: 19-year-old Spencer, 21-year-old Sidney, and 14-year-old Sophia.</p><p>Sidney, who has been estranged from Tamra for years, began communicating again. So have Simon and Spencer.</p><p>Simon has even had more contact with 34-year-old Ryan Vieth (below), even though they basically never got along.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“He told me the news and we both literally started crying. I just couldn’t believe it,” Tamra Judge reveals to People.</p><p>Simon told her at a Starbucks, she shares, adding:&nbsp;“My first thought was, ‘I don’t want to take my kids to their dad’s funeral.'”</p><p>“And immediately, any ill feelings between the two of us just vanished,” Tamra characterizes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“At the end of the day, none of that matters,” she emphasizes of past grudges. “All we have to do is rally together to make it through this.”</p><p>“It’s kind of like a new beginning for me and my family. It’s really brought everyone closer together,” Simon reveals.</p><p>“When I told Tamra, she said she cried for like, 2-3 days,” he shares.</p><p>“Things changed with our relationship from there, in a good way.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>“We’re getting along in ways we haven’t in years,” he shares. “And she’s become close with my fiancee.”</p><p>Simon adds: “And that shift carried across the board with my kids, too.”</p><p>“That’s what I’ve always wanted,” Simon expresses. “My fiancee, the same thing, she’s always wanted that with my ex-wife, for the kids.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“The kids would prefer it if we all got along,” he adds. “And they see that now, and it’s had such a powerful effect.”</p><p>While he looks on the bright side, Simon is the first to admit that the process of actually fighting the cancer is just awful.</p><p>“The process is the real bad part,” he admits. “It basically attacks all of your organs. You’re like poisoned. It’s been killing me.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“If I had a choice, I probably wouldn’t have done chemo and radiation at the same time, but that’s what they recommended.”</p><p>“It’s like hitting your head with a hammer and pouring gas on yourself,” he characterizes accurately.</p><p>“I was ready to end it the other day, the symptoms were so bad,” Simon reveals. “It’s almost worst than the cancer.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“You go in Monday, you get the chemo,” he narrates. “By Friday, Saturday, Sunday, all the steroids are wearing off that they give you.”</p><p>The steroids wear off “and it really hits you,” Simon describes. “I just curl up in a ball for the whole weekend in my bed.”</p><p>“And then pray that the truck gets off me,” he continues. “Because I was run over by one.”</p><p>“Then they give you a shot that’s supposed to help your white blood cells multiply.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“And that hurts your bones,” he shares, “so you feel like you can’t walk.”</p><p>“And then the radiation, basically they hit me in my neck, my throat, and the tonsil area,” he details.</p><p>“It’s like a 9 out of 10 pain. It’s a lot of pain,” Simon admits.</p><p>“You have an appetite but you can’t eat anything because your taste buds are gone, or they taste and smell like chemo – this metallic, disgusting taste and smell.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>“My throat is swollen and bleeding which makes it difficult to swallow even water,” Simon continues.</p><p>“I have hope,” he emphasizes. “Doctors have said I’m doing really well so far.”</p><p>“They look at me and they go, ‘Man, you don’t look like you’re going through chemo.’ So that’s good, the prognosis is good.”</p><p>“I’m a huge optimist; the glass is always half full, not half empty. And I’ve always been that way, the cancer just enhanced it.”</p><p>Simon emphasizes: “If your attitude sucks — if you start believing, ‘Oh my God, cancer’s a death sentence’ — then you’re done.”</p><p>“I think, if you had to pick out of from all my family, I was the right person to get it,” he expresses. “I can survive this, at least mentally.”</p><p>“Listen, if it’s my time to die, it’s my time to die,” Simon adds. “I’ve lived a good life, and you can’t do anything about that.”</p><p>“But if it’s not, then I’m going to fight this. I’m going to fight it with a smile and a laugh, and I’m going to beat it. It’s whatever my destiny is.”</p><a href=#><img width=865 height=1014 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/01/tamra-judge-on-the-couch.png alt="Tamra Judge on the Couch" decoding=async sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 40px), 720px" data-trellis-processed=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h2 class=block-title>Tamra Judge Appreciation Day: This OG of the OC is Bravo’s GOAT!</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2toX2V%2FcL%2FIpqanZZKWv6%2Bx2GacsWWfm3q1rcyrmGaipZm0pnnRnq2emZyoerTAwKCcZmtdqbWzu8CtZJyZnpiys3nDopho</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./wamxgvt6-o9bzjqzldfpvrthjeenjwt3.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Stream Movies, Shows &amp;amp; Live TV</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./best-tiktok-salad-recipes.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Here Are the Best Salad Recipes TikTok Has to Offer</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-offensive-t-shirts-that-have-been-removed-from-stores.html>15 Most Offensive T-Shirts Ever</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./extreme-makeover-jillian-harris-edition.html>Extreme Makeover: Jillian Harris Edition!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lizzy-mcalpine-tour-2022-how-buy-tickets.html>Lizzy McAlpine tour 2022: How can I buy tickets?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nichole-lynel.html>Nichole Lynel</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./teddy-afro.html>Teddy Afro</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 LoopBlog.
