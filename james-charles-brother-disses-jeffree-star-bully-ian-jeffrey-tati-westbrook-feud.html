Jeffree weighed in on James’ recent falling out with mentor <strong>Tati Westbrook</strong> and he had some brutal things to say. Seventeen-year-old Ian took to Twitter on May 12 and wrote, “Why does everyone act so tough on the internet” after Jeffree laid into James. He claimed that he banned him from his home and that James “is a danger to society.” “Everything Tati said is 100% true” he added about her lengthy explanation about why she severed her friendship and working relationship with James.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Jeffree was still raging as he commented on Ian’s tweet by writing, “Why is your brother a predator? Why’d you really have to move back up to NYC? Exactly. Shut the f*** up.” There is no indication that James Charles is a “predator” and Jeffree’s comments upset some fans. “What a low blow for an adult to attack yet another kid,” one person wrote,&nbsp;while another fan tweeted, “I agree with this 100. Why he tryna come for Ian? Jeffree is sad, he needs to mind his own business.” Eventually both Jeffree and Ian deleted their tweets.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>The whole drama began on May 10 when Tati, 37, uploaded a YouTube video to explain why she <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>ended her friendship</a> with fellow beauty blogger/controversial “influencer” James, 19. “Fame, power and a fat bank account will change almost anyone. And if you don’t have people that tell you to your face that you’re doing the wrong things you will change,” she explained.&nbsp;Tati continued, “I don’t think there is any getting through to you and I don’t want to be friends with you. I don’t want to be associated with you, and I need to say that very publicly so that this chapter can just be closed.” She also accused James Charles of trying to “trick a straight man into thinking he’s gay.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/james-charles-younger-brother-defends-him-against-jeffree-star-in-scathing-clapback-see-message-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>James then apologized later that night in a tearful 8 minute YouTube video, telling her and fans, “I’m so disappointed in myself that I ruined my relationship that did mean the most to me, even though I didn’t show it all the time…What sucks the most is that I know there’s nothing I can say or do to ever earn that friendship or trust back.” James also addressed the “boy situation,” by saying, “Tati really was one of the people to sit me down and tell me how it looked from the outside and let me know, ‘Hey, talking to these boys might get you in trouble one day.’ And she was right.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>James promoting SugarBearHair’s sleep vitamins at Coachella on April 22, “blindsided” Tati, who owns a rival vitamin company, Halo Beauty. It was the straw that broke the camel’s back when it came to their friendship. Tati and her husband <strong>James Westbrook</strong> took James under their wing three years ago when he was still a rising beauty influencer and James acknowledged that the couple “took on a parental role” and supported him “when no one else wanted to.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Meanwhile on the night of May 12, Tati announced that she wouldn’t have a new video up the next day, telling fans on Twitter “There won’t be a video tomorrow. My heart is still too heavy. I feel like I need to remind you that we can hold truth & inspire change without grabbing onto hate. Honor your blessings, don’t abuse them. Celebrating pain will only bring it to your door. love you guys, see you soon.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlpZH12e5BrZqOZnZrAbq%2FHmqmlnaNir7O706Gcq2WUnsC0sdJmoZ6elqeypnnSrZirZZKqua3FjKKYp2WamrOnvsSyZK2ZpJ56uLHSrZmrp5%2Bgeqex1J1m</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./melissa-walker-custom-designer-of-dollface-season-2.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Melissa Walker- Custom Designer Of Dollface Season 2</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./elizabeth-hurley-open-to-making-fourth-austin-powers-movie-in-different-costumes-exclusive.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Elizabeth Hurley Says She'd 'Of Course' Do Another Austin Powers Movie</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-offensive-t-shirts-that-have-been-removed-from-stores.html>15 Most Offensive T-Shirts Ever</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./extreme-makeover-jillian-harris-edition.html>Extreme Makeover: Jillian Harris Edition!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lizzy-mcalpine-tour-2022-how-buy-tickets.html>Lizzy McAlpine tour 2022: How can I buy tickets?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nichole-lynel.html>Nichole Lynel</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./teddy-afro.html>Teddy Afro</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 LoopBlog.
