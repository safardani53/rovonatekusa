The <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>American Idol</a> season 21 contestant made the top 2 alongside <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Iam Tongi</strong></a>.

Megan is a Christian singer.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-4>For her American Idol audition, Megan performed Christian music singer <strong>Lauren Daigle’s</strong> “You Say.” Lauren actually surprised Megan during her audition and performed with her. In her introduction video, Megan revealed that she was previously in a band that was performing in bars. Performing in bars wasn’t what she really wanted to do, so she decided to switch to Christian music after her grandfather’s guidance.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>HollywoodLife</strong> spoke EXCLUSIVELY</a> with Megan ahead of the finale, and she admitted it’s been such a great experience being able to be open about her faith on American Idol. “To be able to showcase you know my Christianity on&nbsp;Idol, and the fact that I want to be a Christian artist, it can be really difficult sometimes just because of the way the world is today. I feel like that’s why God put me here just because he knows how strong I am. It means a lot to me, and I’ll always be blessed to be able to share this on any platform,” she told&nbsp;<strong>HollywoodLife</strong>.</p><h2>2. Megan previously competed on The Voice.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>Megan was a contestant during season 18 of The Voice. She was on <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Kelly Clarkson’s</strong></a> team. She made the top 9 before she was eliminated. Megan also competed in the same season as fellow top 20 contestant <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Michael Williams</strong></a>.</p><h2>3. Megan is from Georgia.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>Megan hails from Douglasville, Georgia. Prior to American Idol, Megan worked as a waitress at the Landmark Country Buffet with her mom.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/American-Idol-Megan-Danielle-abc-embed-2.jpg><h2>4. Megan blamed herself for her dad leaving.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>Ahead of her top 20 performance, Megan revealed that her parents split up when she was 7 years old. “My siblings and I actually watched my dad walking out of the house,” she said. “I put a lot of blame on myself for my dad leaving. It made me feel kind of worthless, like I wasn’t a good daughter or even a good sister.” Megan admitted that it’s been a “lifelong struggle” for her to believe in herself.</p><h2>5. Megan’s grandfather was an inspiration to her.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-9>Megan’s grandfather, <strong>Chuck</strong>, passed away about a year ago. The singer said that her grandfather was the “most important person in my life” and “one of my biggest fans.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmaho2K6prPAp2SdmZ6esq24xGaYpp2inrCiuoyim6ikXWp9eXyVbW1o</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-was-nanci-griffith-cause-of-death.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who was singer Nanci Griffith and what was her cause of death?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./mickie-krzyzewski.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Mickie Krzyzewski [2023 Update]: Net Worth &amp;amp; Kids</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-offensive-t-shirts-that-have-been-removed-from-stores.html>15 Most Offensive T-Shirts Ever</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./extreme-makeover-jillian-harris-edition.html>Extreme Makeover: Jillian Harris Edition!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lizzy-mcalpine-tour-2022-how-buy-tickets.html>Lizzy McAlpine tour 2022: How can I buy tickets?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nichole-lynel.html>Nichole Lynel</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./teddy-afro.html>Teddy Afro</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 LoopBlog.
