The fact people want to share in it and do their own little bit is incredible.</p><p>“This will be with mates, for mates and alongside mates, absolutely. Look across the world at big cities where marathons are run, there’s nothing like this.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ IN RUGBY LEAGUE</h2></p><p>“And the fact 12,500 people are taking part shows the affection Leeds has for Rob. We couldn’t have dreamed of getting this number.</p><p>“I’m looking forward to running with Rob and spending some time together – I’ll be 13, Rob’s got seven and his wife Lindsey’s got number one.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Rugby League</h2></p><p>“We’ve not done any training. We ran a 10k together last July and that’s part of the challenge, doing something neither of us have done before. The unknown adds to the fun of it.</p><p>“He’s in a custom-made chair but it could be a bumpy ride. I’ll try and find him the safest, comfiest route but if there are hills, there are hills. If it rains, it rains.”</p><p>Sinfield's feats – seven marathons in seven days, a 101-mile continuous run in 24 hours and seven ultra marathons in seven days, from Murrayfield to Old Trafford - have been inspiring enough and he is a figurehead of the MND community.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/1e973f86-86f6-487f-8ab0-d45c395ea591.jpg><p>Work as England RU defence coach may occupy many thoughts ahead of this year's World Cup but he still receives messages from people and families living with the condition.</p><p>He will be alongside other inspiring stories, like former triathlete Sam Perkins, of Leicestershire, who is being pushed to raise funds and awareness for <a href=#>Stand Against MND (SAM).</a></p><p>Sinfield added: “For every 10 nice ones, you get a sad one as well. That just reinforces how much we’ve got to keep banging the drum, keep going and keep trying to shift the dial on it.</p><p>“It’s brought that MND community together, Wider than that, it’s brought communities together in that we can all do a little bit to help. That’s been a driving force for today.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ac4484f4-9655-46b0-bbe9-e42c65b924d3.jpg><p>“Every penny counts and every bit of awareness is important. My job’s to keep raising as much money as I can so the great minds in science and research can try to find a cure.</p><p>“The work Doddie Weir did made a huge difference. Teams are working together, that’s what this is about. We get to run as a 12,500 team and keep banging that drum.”</p><p>Sinfield and <a href=#>Burrow</a> will be joined by several former team-mates and familiar faces as they take on the 'hilly' course.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>But the 42-year-old hopes this is the first of a growing event, which is already booked in for next year.</p><p>He told SunSport: “We hope this will be something that becomes part of the running calendar across the UK and as long as I can run, I’ll be doing it.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZH9zf5Rpb2lsX6Cyt7XNZqqippaesq2wjKumm2WSqr%2Bzu9Zmo56dlKh6rrrDZqSaqpGptbC6jJ%2Bsp5yilra0tc2gZg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./sister-wives-janelle-brown-reveals-skin-cancer-diagnosis.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Sister Wives Janelle Brown Reveals Skin Cancer Diagnosis</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kate-middleton-knit-skirt-8362296.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kate Middleton's Knit Skirt Is a Comfy Alternative to Jeans: Get the Look</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-offensive-t-shirts-that-have-been-removed-from-stores.html>15 Most Offensive T-Shirts Ever</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./extreme-makeover-jillian-harris-edition.html>Extreme Makeover: Jillian Harris Edition!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lizzy-mcalpine-tour-2022-how-buy-tickets.html>Lizzy McAlpine tour 2022: How can I buy tickets?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nichole-lynel.html>Nichole Lynel</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./teddy-afro.html>Teddy Afro</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 LoopBlog.
