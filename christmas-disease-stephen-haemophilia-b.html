they later called it Factor IX.</p><p>The researchers published their findings in the <a aria-label="British Medical Journal entry (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">British Medical Journal</a> on December 27, 1952, just a couple days after Christmas.</p><p>The paper was titled: 'Christmas Disease: A Condition Previously Mistaken for Haemophilia'.</p><p>Nowadays, Christmas Disease is often referred to as haemophilia B.</p><p>But these findings were a turning point in the study of haemophilia and blood coagulation.</p><p>Meanwhile, Stephen's name became well known among medical circles.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>A tragic end</h2><p>Stephen grew up to study photography at Ryerson University and worked for some years as a medical photographer at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto.</p><p>Like many people with his condition, Stephen relied on blood transfusions to treat excessive blood loss.</p><p>But this spelt tragedy for him as the AIDS crisis swept through the world in the early eighties.</p><p>In 1985, at the age of 38, Stephen was diagnosed with the <a href=#>human immunodeficiency virus</a> (HIV).</p><p>He wasn't the only one. According to Andre Picard's The Gift of Death, which examined Canada's tainted blood tragedy, almost half of the people with haemophilia living there had <a href=#>HIV</a> by 1989.</p><p>As he started a treatment called zidovudine (AZT), Stephen got involved in efforts to secure financial compensation for those impacted by contaminated blood.</p><p>His advocacy included doing archival work and appearing in a documentary about the issue.</p><p>Stephen eventually received compensation four years before his death.</p><p>In July 1993, he was diagnosed with stage 4 malignant <a href=#>melanoma</a> after ignoring a leg lesion for two years.</p><p>In December of that year, Stephen was admitted to palliative care and died four days short of Christmas on December 21, 1993.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is haemophilia B?</h2><p>Haemophilia B - also known as Factor IX deficiency - is a type of clotting disorder that's much rarer than classic haemophilia, known as haemophilia A.</p><p>It occurs when a specific protein is missing from the blood, meaning it can't clot in the usual way when someone is injured, according to the Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children (GOSH).</p><p>This can put people at risk of losing a lot of blood, which can be life-threatening.</p><p>As with classic haemophilia, only boys are affected by it and mums tend to be the carriers of the gene that causes haemophilia B.</p><p>The mutation is passed from parent to child in most cases.</p><p>But in some cases, the gene mutation occurs&nbsp;out of the blue with no&nbsp;family history of bleeding disorders.</p><p>The age at which children start to show signs of haemophilia B varies - they might crop up soon after birth or not become apparent until an injury or surgery.</p><p>People with the condition&nbsp;may bleed more severely following injury or&nbsp;for a longer time.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Bleeding can also occur inside the body.</p><p>People with the condition have a normal lifespan but they may need to avoid certain activities such as sports which carry risk of injury.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/christmas-disease-condition-previously-mistaken-866274878.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57x56YpayYZIZ6f5RraW5nk52%2Fqr%2FTppisZZSewKat0p5krKyVpbWmuoyhmJ6ln6W1qrjImmSbZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./yris-palmer.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Yris Palmer</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./sheena-brook.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Sheena Brook</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-offensive-t-shirts-that-have-been-removed-from-stores.html>15 Most Offensive T-Shirts Ever</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./extreme-makeover-jillian-harris-edition.html>Extreme Makeover: Jillian Harris Edition!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lizzy-mcalpine-tour-2022-how-buy-tickets.html>Lizzy McAlpine tour 2022: How can I buy tickets?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nichole-lynel.html>Nichole Lynel</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./teddy-afro.html>Teddy Afro</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 LoopBlog.
