I won a few trophies playing little football. I talk about football on tv for a living (won a few trophies doing that too)” on Instagram.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>However, one thing he is really proud of is his family. Howard often posts about his sons&nbsp;on social media when he does not talk about work. That being said, he prefers to keep his wife and daughter out of the spotlight.</p><h2>Howard Has Three Children</h2><p>Howard <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">retired</a> from the NFL in 2002 after a very successful career. The next big step in his life after stepping down from the sport? Marriage.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>He&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">married</a> Rebkah Funk on May 31, 2003. Together, the couple has <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">three children</a>: daughter Sydney, and two sons, Dhamir and Desmond Jr.</p><p>His sons make frequent appearances on the former NFL star’s social media. There, he can be seen surprising his sons with a PS5 or spending time with them.</p><h2>A Proud Dad</h2><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>The sports analyst is not shy of showing off his sons to the world. On May 16,&nbsp;2019, which was coincidentally a day after his birthday, Howard <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">shared</a> a clip of his son Desmond Jr. receiving an award, and he couldn’t be happier. He called it the best birthday present he received and added "#ProudFather" and "#HappyBirthday" to his&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Twitter</a> post. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Howard also tries his best at parenting and has spoken about being a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">role model</a> for one's&nbsp;children. He even shared in a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">tweet</a> that one of his favorite ways to connect with his sons is through cooking, referring to them as&nbsp;his sous chefs. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>He Hasn't Posted About His Wife and Daughter</h2><p>For some unknown reasons, Howard has opted not to post about his wife and daughter on social media. If you go through his social media, you can see all kinds of posts about his work and funny videos, but there isn’t much about the women in his life.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>However, his wife, Funk, has posted some pictures of their daughter. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-5 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Scott Torgerson’s Dead Joke Angered Howard’s Wife</h2><p>Back in 2012, the football analyst's wife was quite furious&nbsp;at Ohio radio broadcaster Scott Torgerson’s joke. Torgerson had <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">tweeted</a> that he wished Howard, who used to play for Ohio state’s chief rival Michigan, would either get fired or die so that he could watch ESPN College GameDay again.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Torgerson later apologized for his tweet, but Rebkah wasn’t happy with the apology. She shared her discontentment with a sarcastic&nbsp;“Thx for the ‘apologizes'."</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>@myguythetorg thx for the 'apologizes'. Are you fortunate enough to be a father? Know who didn't get your 'total (dead) joke'? Our daughter. — rebkah howard (@pink_funk) <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">October 14, 2012</a></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGipnqSRqbawutKhoKlnlJrArrvNnWShp6eWv6V51qKdnmWTnbatsNGepWackaq0qcDEq2Ssp56oe6nAzKU%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./farrah-abraham-destroyed-by-dr-phil-in-awesome-interview.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>DESTROYED By Dr. Phil in Awesome Interview</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./dale-gordon.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Dale Gordon</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-offensive-t-shirts-that-have-been-removed-from-stores.html>15 Most Offensive T-Shirts Ever</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./extreme-makeover-jillian-harris-edition.html>Extreme Makeover: Jillian Harris Edition!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lizzy-mcalpine-tour-2022-how-buy-tickets.html>Lizzy McAlpine tour 2022: How can I buy tickets?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nichole-lynel.html>Nichole Lynel</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./teddy-afro.html>Teddy Afro</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 LoopBlog.
