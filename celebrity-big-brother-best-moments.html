At the time, his ex-wife Angie was in the CBB house, and bosses delivered the news to her via the diary room.</p><p>She tried to keep the news quiet, but made the wrong decision by breaking the news to housemate Tiffany ‘New York’ Pollard first – whose OTT reaction became iconic.</p><p>Turned out she thought that fellow housemate David Gest had died – and didn’t realise Angie meant David Bowie.</p><p>The moment became the most hilariously awkward moment in the show’s history, and prompted David Gest to name his stage show ‘I’m Not Dead’. Sadly he actually died from a stroke just a few months later.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/NINTCHDBPICT000004490641.jpg><h2><strong>Verne and Ulrika perform Endless Love</strong></h2><p>Appearing together on the show in 2009, Austin Powers star Verne Troyer and Ulrika Johnson shared a little love during one of the tasks by performing classic ballad, Endless Love, together.</p><p>Both more than a little tone deaf, the hilarious moment saw Verne’s head almost completely disappear under a massive Lionel Richie style wig and moustache, which Ulrika channelled the most bizarre version of Diana Ross ever in a huge black wig and a dress that looked like it was made out of a shower curtain.</p><p>Together they made one hilarious – and unforgettable – BB moment.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/NINTCHDBPICT000439315796.jpg><h2><strong>George Galloway the Cat</strong></h2><p>Labour MP George Galloway was branded a ‘laughing stock’ by his fellow members of Parliament over the cringeworthy moment he pretended to be a cat for fellow housemate Rula Lenska.</p><p>The then-51 year old wore a bathrobe as he crawled on his hands and knees towards the star and ‘licked cream’ from her cupped hands in the living room before she petted him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/1890220.main_image.jpg><h2><strong>The Bondage Task</strong></h2><p>There is very little not to love about this crazy moment in CBB history – whether it’s your favourite celebrities clad in PVC gear, Lee Ryan awkwardly pole dancing or Jasmine Waltz showing him how it should be done.</p><p>However, nothing can take away the sight of Lionel Blair dressed as a leather daddy, simulating sex on one of the girls before necking back a cocktail as the others show off their dancing skills.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/NINTCHDBPICT000208992631.jpg><h2><strong>Megan’s Hangry Meltdown</strong></h2><p>If anyone ever questions whether or not ‘hangry’ is a thing – show them this clip.</p><p>Volatile Megan reached her limits when she started demanding food from the bosses after being put on rations as part of a task.</p><p>Wringing her fingers through her hair she ranted to the housemates in the bedroom that she was “starving” and screamed at the diary room door that she needed food and didn’t want to eat the “s***” that was given to her.</p><p>As Steph Davies can’t help but crack up laughing, Megan gets louder and louder – soon even she can see the funny side and starts laughing too.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/NINTCHDBPICT000148575298.jpg><h2><strong>Perez Hilton’s Garden Dance</strong></h2><p>Perez was, quite possibly, the most antagonistic housemate to ever set foot in the Elstree compound in 2015 – and this moment was the straw that broke the camel’s back.</p><p>Making sex noises as he paraded shirtless around the house, Perez was seen dry-humping various lawn ornaments, grinding on the window and stripping down to his pants.</p><p>Throughout it all, he chanted: “I’m playing the game right now, and I’m doing it so well.”</p><p>The moment caused LGBT ally Michelle Visage to break down in the diary room, claiming that he was “setting the community back 50 years”.</p><p>However, he didn’t seem to care, and later even claimed to be “proud” of his behaviour.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/jl1.jpg><h2><strong>Frenchy Morgan cuts up Leslie Jordan clothes</strong></h2><p>The French reality star, real name Angelique, started an outright war during her appearance on the show after cutting up fellow contestant Leslie Jordan’s clothes.</p><p>The actor labels him a “sick b****” while she denies everything, saying she was in the bathroom doing her make-up.</p><p>She also casually covers the bedroom floor in water and hides supplies from the house, causing him to say that he was going to “s*** in her make-up case” given the chance.</p><p>Thankfully he didn’t.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/NINTCHDBPICT000259246122.jpg><h2><strong>Katie Waissel’s famous grandmother</strong></h2><p>Heavy D was a massive wind-up merchant during his time in CBB across August 2016 – but this epic comeback is easily the most memorable part of it.</p><p>After taking a stab at her celebrity, Storage Hunters star Heavy was given a stern talking down from fitness blogger and former X Factor star.</p><p>As their housemates – including Stephen Bear - watched on in shock, Katie branded herself more important, revealed she was paid more to be there.</p><p>Heavy defended himself as “current” while she was just an “X Factor reject” – and after yelling at each other some more, she walks off before screaming “my grandma is more famous than you, you f***ing piece of s***!”</p><p>She was referring to her nan, Sheila Vogel-Coupe - who was once the UK’s oldest sex worker.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/NINTCHDBPICT000256532598.jpg><h2><strong>Frankie Grande snogs Grant Bovey</strong></h2><p>Split into robots vs humans, the housemates were tasked with distracting the opposite group by any means possible – while the other team were forced not to react at all.</p><p>Chloe Khan going first, she tried to show off her womanly wiles – but it did nothing for the stone-faced team.</p><p>However, Grant Bovey then declared he was actually gay, and went all in for a heavy handed snog with the camp Frankie Grande – much to the shock of the entire house.</p><p>While their romance might have been fake, their minute-long love fest was clearly burned into the memory of all involved.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/NINTCHDBPICT000588679610-e1592050159149.jpg><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">More on Big Brother</h2></p><h2><strong>Jackie Stallone’s entrance</strong></h2><p>Model and actress Brigitte Nielsen was dealt a shock in the third series of the show – as he ex-mother-in-law entered the house for a stay.</p><p>During a kings and queens task for the 2005 housemates, the group were told to bow for the newest addition to the house.</p><p>Jackie Stallone – mum to Sylvester Stallone - then epically struts in to the room, and while she tries to hide it, Brigitte looks horrified.</p><p>“Oh my god, Jackie!” announced Brigitte, causing the amazingly chilled response: “Yeah…I’m Jackie”</p><ul><li><strong>Big Brother: Best Shows Ever kicks off TOMORROW on E4 at 9pm</strong></li></ul><p><strong data-rich-text-format-boundary=true>Got a story?</strong> email <a
