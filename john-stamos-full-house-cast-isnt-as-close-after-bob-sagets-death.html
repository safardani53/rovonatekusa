But we’re not together as much as we used to [be],” he added. “We were a family, and I think people got that too. Both on and off camera.”</p><p>The hit sitcom, which ran from 1987 to 1995, followed Danny Tanner (Saget) as he attempted to raise his three daughters — D.J. (<a href=#><strong>Candace Cameron Bure</strong></a>), Stephanie (<a href=#><strong>Jodie Sweetin</strong></a>) and Michelle (<a href=#><strong>Mary-Kate Olsen</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Ashley Olsen</strong></a>) — after his wife’s death. <a href=#>Danny’s brother-in-law, Jesse Katsopolis</a> (Stamos), and best friend Joey Gladstone (<a href=#><strong>Dave Coulier</strong></a>) subsequently move in to help him out.</p><p>Full House, which also starred <a href=#><strong>Lori Loughlin</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Andrea Barber</strong></a> and <strong>Steve Weinger</strong>, <a href=#>was revived by Netflix as Fuller House in 2016.</a> Many of the show’s OG cast members appeared throughout the show’s five-season run.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/John-Stamos-Admits-Full-House-Cast-Isnt-as-Close-After-Bob-Sagets-Death-inline-2.jpg><p>In January 2022, Saget <a href=#>died at age 65 in his Orlando, Florida, hotel room</a>. Us Weekly confirmed that authorities declared that there were no signs of foul play when they arrived at the hotel. One month later, the Orange County, Florida, Medical Examiner confirmed that Saget’s passing <a href=#>was the result of “blunt head trauma” from an “accidental” fall.</a></p><p>The Full House cast <a href=#>released a statement after Saget’s passing</a>, which read, “Thirty-five years ago, we came together as a TV family, but we became a real family. He was a brother to us guys, a father to us girls and a friend to all of us. Bob, we love you dearly.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/John-Stamos-Admits-Full-House-Cast-Isnt-as-Close-After-Bob-Sagets-Death-inline-1.jpg><p>While speaking to InStyle, Stamos <a href=#>praised Saget for being an exceptional friend.</a></p><p>“Bob never left anything on the table. Every time you talked to him he said I love you, I care about you, I’m proud of you. If I was hanging on a cliff on a branch and I had one phone call, it’d be Bob,” Stamos added on Monday. “And he probably wouldn’t be there, and I’d have to call back, then he’d call me sixteen times, ‘Are you still alive? You hanging? I’ll be there.'”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Stamos plans to continue to keep Saget’s memory alive by talking about him — including in his upcoming memoir.</p><p>“Not only did I think I’d write a book, I was adamant about it. Then when Bob died, I want to talk about it,” the Big Shot alum said about <a href=#>his book If You Would Have Told Me</a>, which comes out on Tuesday, October 24. “I want to tell everybody what they don’t know about him. I want to tell everybody how important he was.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajp5ijerTAwKamrGWWqrmteceorKydXZiutMCMoqqnrF2WwG6vy6iqnmWRm8Gmvoybpptlo5a0psDSZpuemaSdfA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kirk-cameron.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kirk Cameron</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./farley-granger-19250701-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Farley Granger (Movie Actor) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-offensive-t-shirts-that-have-been-removed-from-stores.html>15 Most Offensive T-Shirts Ever</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./extreme-makeover-jillian-harris-edition.html>Extreme Makeover: Jillian Harris Edition!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lizzy-mcalpine-tour-2022-how-buy-tickets.html>Lizzy McAlpine tour 2022: How can I buy tickets?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nichole-lynel.html>Nichole Lynel</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./teddy-afro.html>Teddy Afro</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 LoopBlog.
