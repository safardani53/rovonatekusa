In October 2021, <a href=#>Dave Chappelle</a> came under fire for making comments about trans women. <a href=#>Kevin Hart</a> also had a scandal of his own back in 2018 when old tweets about anti-gay rhetoric resurfaced around the time he was set to host the Academy Awards. And now, it appears that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Aries Spears</a> is the current comedian under fire, and with good reason.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Many comedy fans remember Aries from his eight-year stint on Mad TV. He became well known for his celebrity impersonations. Additionally, Aries appeared on other comedic platforms including Def Comedy Jam and It's Showtime at the Apollo. However, after Aries made some disrespectful comments about <a href=#>Lizzo</a> — to which the entertainer famously clapped back — fans are interested in learning about his finances. Here’s what we know.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Aries Spears has earned a decent net worth as a comedian.</h2><p>As of this writing, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a> reports that Aries currently has a net worth of $4 million. This number reflects Aries’s work as a stand-up comedian, screenwriter, voice actor, and actor. Over the years, Aries has earned over 40 acting credits for his work in projects such as 1996’s Jerry Maguire, The Proud Family from 2001 to 2003, The Boondocks in 2010, and more. So, Aries earning a net worth of $4 million seems to be well deserved.</p><p class="sc-eEVlDD iAFcKh"><span>Aries Spears</span></p><p class="sc-jlZIZy iWVnnf">Comedian, Actor, Voice actor, Screenwriter</p><p><strong>Net worth:</strong> $4 million</p><p>Aries Spears is a stand-up comedian and actor who is best known for his role on Mad TV.

It’s a question that surely needs an answer after Aries made disrespectful comments about Lizzo.</p><p>In an Aug. 25, 2022, interview on The Art of Dialogue podcast, Aries talked smack about Lizzo’s appearance. Host Mighty Bolton brought up Lizzo as an artist who makes great music, and Aries immediately ripped the star for her appearance.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>“I can’t get past the fact that she looks like the s--t emoji,” Aries said. “Very beautiful girl. “She’s got a very pretty face, but she keeps showing her body off [n-word] like, come on, man. Come on, yo.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Aries continued, “I’m not the most in-shape [n-word] in the world, but still when you’re funny and you have swagger and confidence, and you’re decent looking ... I think I’m at least handsome, you get some p---y. But a woman that’s built like a plate of mashed potatoes is in trouble.”</p><p>The comedian went on to say more hurtful things about the star and women who support Lizzo.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Not only have fans lit Aries a new one on social media, but the “About Damn Time” songstress also took a moment at the 2022 MTV Video Music Awards to clap back.

In case you forgot, Miley made comments about Nicki’s sentiments about not being nominated for Video of the Year at the time for the hit song “Anaconda.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>So of course, it was only fitting that Lizzo brought the same energy to silence the haters.</p><p>“And now, to the b---hes that got something to say about me in the press,” Lizzo said as the crowd yelled in agreement. “You know what, I’m not going to say nothing.
