While it can be easy to buy into trends, we wanted to work our own magic and try a range of popular tools to see which ones deserve the PEOPLE Tested title of “best.” We tested 34 hair dryers (including 21 in 2023) over the course of two years.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">However, there are a few factors you should take into account when looking for that perfect dryer. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Justine Marjan</a>, celebrity hairstylist to Khloé Kardashian and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Ashley Graham</a>, says these include heat control to ensure hair health, quiet operation, and concentrated airflow to ward off frizz. Plus, the hair dryer should be lightweight, so you can easily move your wrist while styling.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Just don’t forget to use a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>heat protectant</a> before blasting your wet strands with your new tool. Without further ado, let’s jump into our best picks — you may find your next beauty essential below.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Here are the best hair dryers PEOPLE Tested.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-things-to-consider-when-buying-a-hair-dryer></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Things to Consider When Buying a Hair Dryer</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Hair Type</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The biggest factor to consider when shopping for a new hair dryer is the type of hair that you have. Oftentimes straight or wavy hair will require different hair dryer functions (think the volume from the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">BaBylissPRO Nano Titanium Hair Dryer</a>) than curly or textured hair (the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Pattern Blow Dryer</a> was our favorite), so identifying your hair type and catering to it will deliver the best results. While there is no “type” of hair dryer that works best for certain hair types, Justine Marjan, celebrity hairstylist to Khloé Kardashian and Ashley Graham, puts hair protection at the forefront when it comes to blow drying. Even a few spritzes of a good <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>hair detangler</a> before blow-drying can work wonders. It’s of peak importance that the dryer does “not get too hot, so that the hair health is protected,” says Marjan — which goes for any hair type.<br></p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Speed and Heat Settings</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Each and every hair dryer comes with its own set of features, but it’s up to you to decide which ones are worth buying into. If customizable speed and several heat settings is up on your list of priorities, then keeping an eye out for multiple settings is important (think the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Hot Tools Pro Artist Ionic Hair Dryer</a> and its several heat and speed combos). Cool shot buttons and special features like turbo or volume settings are an added perk, as well. For those looking for a timesaver that delivers smooth and volumized results without extra tools, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>hot air brushes</a> are another great option.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Attachments</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Many hair dryers will come with a concentrator, but attachments can go as far as wide-tooth combs and flyaway treatments (ahem, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Dyson Supersonic</a>). Marjan points out how versatile your hair dryer can be once you add attachments, depending on what look you’re going for. “You can use [a] comb attachment to stretch out curls, [a] wide styling hair dryer nozzle for smooth blow dries, [a] diffuser to shape curls or no attachment for added volume." Finding which attachments work for your hair will dictate whether or not you need them in tandem with your hair dryer (plus what other <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>hair products</a> you want to have in your arsenal).</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Wattage</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">A hair dryer’s wattage indicates how much power the dryer produces, which, in turn, gives you an idea of how long it will take the dryer to dry your hair. A lower wattage means your hair will take longer to dry while a higher wattage will dry your hair faster. That said, you don’t want a dryer with too high a wattage as it can be damaging to your hair. The hair dryers on our list range from 1500 to 2000 watts which is a good benchmark for wattage.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-hot-tools-pro-artist-black-gold-2000-watt-ionic-hair-dryer></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Overall</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Hot Tools Pro Artist Black Gold Ionic Hair Dryer</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Hot Tools Pro Artist Black Gold 2000 Watt Ionic Hair Dryer" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/pZModzWp-j0cI3jIamHjuWGgT80=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/hot-tools-pro-artist-black-gold-2000-watt-ionic-hair-dryer-5c89a3edfca84e9293dbe0f5c9686e7d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Features</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Drying Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Overall Look</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=2><li readability=2><p>This all-star dryer includes four heat, three speed, and four styling settings for the blowout of your dreams.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>It comes with two extra concentrator nozzles and a diffuser attachment.</p></li><li readability=0><p>You can achieve salon-level results at a much lower price with this hair dryers than with many competitors on this list.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Though we tested this hair dryer last year, we still love this budget-friendly tool in 2023. This sleek dryer from Hot Tools scored a solid 5 stars across all testing categories — it's the only one to achieve a perfect score in this entire roundup. The styling tool has 2,000 watts of drying ability (in other words, it’s incredibly fast) and a plethora of features, such as multiple speed and heat settings, a turbo boost button, and a cool shot and ionizer switch to amp up the volume or smoothness of your hair. It also includes two extra concentrator nozzles. We were the most impressed by this product — it was our favorite by far.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We put this dryer to the real test by trying it out on a humid day in New York City (the ultimate recipe for frizzy strands) and were still met with fabulously shiny results. A blowout took just about 20 minutes with this Hot Tools dryer, which is great for the busy lives we lead.&nbsp;Best of all, this hair dryer is made for use on all hair types — but with the addition of the diffuser attachment, it’s even easier to smooth frizz and style your curls.&nbsp;Some of the styling settings may be confusing at first, but it's worth investing the time learning so you can get salon-level results at home.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For a very reasonable price, this hair dryer had all of the perks of some of the most expensive hair dryers.

We tried the “Special Version,” which comes with two concentrators and a diffuser. Shaped like the Dyson Supersonic (but at a much more affordable price), this powerhouse tool took our strands, whether we had type 1 hair or type 3 curls, to smooth, carefully-styled blowouts in nearly half of our typical dry times. And despite having several rounds of testing with all-new products since we first encountered this one, we keep coming back to it as a tie for the best overall.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We took these home to test for a bit longer, to see if the Laifen performed as well as it did in the lab over weeks of regular use. Due to its convenient, lightweight design and maneuverability, we could immediately tell how much we would love incorporating this tool into our routine. We did wish the instructions had a little more beef to them (the futuristic tool is a little confusing for old-school hair dryer users), but the machine felt intuitive enough to figure out. It was effortless to magnetically snap on our attachments, remove them, and do all of our blow drying in between. We just wish the dryer was compatible with curling attachments as well. The nearly 6-foot-long cord made it easy to float around our bathrooms as we styled our hair and the volume was so low that we could watch a show and chat with our loved ones simultaneously (not kidding, we did this).&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">From its effective airflow to its sleek, salon-worthy results and continuously shortened dry times, every aspect of this dryer remained consistent over the four-week testing period. We wish we could add a curling iron attachment to transform it into our own personal Airwraps, but that’s only because we see how very versatile this tool can be. If our stylists are saying that they want to replace their professional dryer with this one, then we think you need to switch out your old one, too.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Hair Type: </strong>All | <strong>Weight:</strong> 0.89 lbs. | <strong>Wattage: </strong>1600 | <strong>Settings: </strong>3 heat / 2 speed / cool shot / auto-cycling (long press) | <strong>Attachments: </strong>3</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-conair-infinitipro-smoothwrap-hair-dryer-with-dual-ion-therapy></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Budget</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Conair Hair Dryer</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon Conair InfinitiPRO SmoothWrap Hair Dryer" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/I0A4TSn4O88MH6EX6thugWPyV0M=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/conair-infinitipro-smoothwrap-hair-dryer-5e81c55faee543569102d981b29eeb4d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Features</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Drying Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.9</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Overall Look</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0.5><li readability=-1><p>Its powerful shot (and higher wattage) dried our hair in only four minutes.</p></li><li readability=0><p>Despite its simple abilities, this hair dryer gave us professional results.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>It made our hair smooth and soft after attaching the concentrator.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Smooth and voluminous hair has never been as attainable as with Conair's hair dryer.

We loved how smooth our strands looked and felt after tacking on the concentrator and appreciated the option to choose from one of these two styling heads to achieve our desired look.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The best part about this dryer, however, was its fairly low price for the superb quality — you usually can’t even find standalone dryers for this amount. Though we do wish this was a little easier for our left-handed friends to use (the buttons are easier for right-handed users to work with), we still think this was a standout styling tool. Whether you use this hair dryer with or without the attachments, you will surely get a fast and smooth blowout.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Hair Type: </strong>All | <strong>Weight:</strong> 2.4 lbs. | <strong>Wattage: </strong>1875 | <strong>Settings: </strong>3 heat / 2 speed / cool shot | <strong>Attachments: </strong>Concentrator, diffuser</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-beginners-revlon-airflow-control-dryer></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for Beginners</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Revlon Airflow Control Dryer</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Ulta Revlon Airflow Control Dryer" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/Hc2NoFvu388oP62oOePify_ZNCk=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/revlon-airflow-control-dryer-373cdf50129f439a98a7220466c737e9.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ulta</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Features</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.6</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Drying Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.7</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Overall Look</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.7</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0.5><li readability=-1><p>This dryer’s super compact design makes it very lightweight and easy to travel with.</p></li><li readability=0><p>It was great for quick, concentrated drying because of its strong airflow and tapered endpiece.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>The price is extremely reasonable for the quality results it delivered.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re just starting on your hair-styling journey, then you may feel a little overwhelmed by the sheer amount of dryers (and the prices they go for) on the market today. That’s why we breathed a sigh of relief when we tried this little tool from Revlon — a compact, lightweight, easy-to-pack dryer with a concentrator built onto the end that packs a total punch. We liked being able to twist the nozzle vertically and horizontally to direct the (powerful!) airflow exactly where we wanted it, which ended up drying our strands surprisingly fast, despite its size.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While it may not be the best option for quick-drying a whole head of hair (a tool with a circular opening and less concentrated airflow may do this better for you), this dryer is a game-changer when it comes to styling. Whether you’re trying to give your hair some shape with a round brush or pump up the volume at your roots, this tool is here to help you achieve the at-home blowout of your dreams — all at a fraction of the price of a trip to the salon.&nbsp;Add a few spritzes of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>texturizing spray</a> and you're good to go.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Hair Type: </strong>All | <strong>Weight:</strong> 2.07 lbs. | <strong>Wattage: </strong>1875 | <strong>Settings: </strong>3 heat / 2 speed / cool shot | <strong>Attachments: </strong>Diffuser</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-professional-olivia-garden-high-performance-professional-hair-dryer></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Professional</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Olivia Garden High Performance Professional Hair Dryer</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Olivia Garden High Performance Professional Hair Dryer" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/yi6dcW7YB_dDyb6_zcn2VPqSP3Y=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/olivia-garden--high-performance-professional-hair-dryer-ca6c6117570943ae958efa8d19cab6b9.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Olivia Garden&nbsp;</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Features</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Drying Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Overall Look</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.7</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1.5><li readability=0><p>This tool’s super thin design made it easier for us to hold and maneuver while we styled our hair.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Its lightweight body ensured that our arms and wrists never got tired while we dried our strands.</p></li><li readability=1><p>All of the hair types that we tested on took well to this dryer, looking smoother and sleeker after use.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If there’s one thing we could all agree on, testers and hairstylists alike, it was that this sleek tool from Olivia Garden was the one to go for if you want a salon-quality blowout. In general, this dryer — equipped with 3 airflow speeds and 3 heat settings — could dry our hair and smooth our strands into shiny, volume-boosted styles in record time.&nbsp;It has a thin design that makes it easy to maneuver, plus it's also lightweight and easy to hold so your arms won't be exhausted by the end of the blow dry.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We were impressed with its strong airflow for its small size, and we appreciated that it dried our hair effectively without burning our scalps. Plus, the buttons were placed in easy-to-reach areas (but not easy to accidentally press mid-style), which made our lives a whole lot easier. And you can even lock your settings with the simple switch of a button, so if you did accidentally lose your grip, you won’t have to worry about unwantedly switching temperatures or speed settings.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We tested all of our dryers across hair types 1 to 4, and we do mean it when we say this dryer is best for professional-level blowouts — but if you want to dry your natural curls, then this may not be the one for you. The diffuser didn’t deliver the dried coils we were going for on Type 3 and 4 hair, which is tricky for someone who wants the duality of styling their hair straight on some days and sporting their natural curls on others.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">But if a voluminous blowout is what you’re going for, then you shouldn’t think twice about the High Performance dryer from Olivia Garden.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Hair Type: </strong>All | <strong>Weight:</strong> 0.81 lbs. | <strong>Wattage: </strong>1875 | <strong>Settings: </strong>3 heat / 3 speed / cool shot | <strong>Attachments: </strong>Concentrator, diffuser</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-investment-dyson-supersonic-hair-dryer></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Investment</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Dyson Supersonic Hair Dryer</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon Dyson Supersonic Hair Dryer" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/GDUHrXPSvH1hIWhoUlyPGJPeOg8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/dyson-supersonic-hair-dryer-813674451dc34a6f9bc9d06f941b4787.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Features</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.7</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Drying Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.9</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Overall Look</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.9</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.9</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1><li readability=1><p>This high-tech hair dryer is extremely customizable, with seven heat and speed settings to choose from.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>You can do everything from flyaway-taming to curl-shaping with these five styling attachments.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>We experienced a quicker drying time with this model compared to others.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Easily the celebrity of the group, the Dyson Supersonic hair dryer is the one that has us talking. It more than meets the high-quality standards we come to expect from <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Dyson products</a>. Outside of its impeccable drying time (between five to ten minutes, depending on hair type) and inventive design, the standout for this product was the five attachments that came with this high-tech hair dryer.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Inside the box, you’ll find a diffuser, gentle air attachment, wide-tooth comb, styling concentrator, and flyaway attachment — all of which can be joined together magnetically. Once we spent some time with the machine and got the hang of the attachments, we were blown away (almost literally — this thing has some powerful airflow, so start low) by how quickly and effectively we achieved the customized blowouts of our dreams.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The only question is — how exactly do you use those magical attachments? If you own the coveted Dyson Airwrap, you may be accustomed to the brand’s advanced fixtures, but if you’re a novice like us, you may be a little confused by the attachments upon first use. In this case, read the instruction manual before crafting your perfect blowout.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Hair Type: </strong>All |&nbsp;<strong>Weight: </strong>1.8 lbs. | <strong>Wattage: </strong>1600 | <strong>Settings: </strong>4 heat / 3 speed | <strong>Attachments:</strong> Flyaway attachment, styling concentrator, diffuser, gentle air attachment, wide-tooth comb</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-thick-hair-babylisspro-porcelain-ceramic-carrera2-dryer></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for Thick Hair</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>BaBylissPRO Porcelain Ceramic Carrera2 Dryer</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon BaBylissPRO Porcelain Ceramic Carrera2 Dryer" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/dKpka4L9f6AgCz1fB0RSBb6TAXY=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/BaBylissPRO-Porcelain-Ceramic-Carrera2-Dryer-7fb754be54a64503aceefb0c7273b24b.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Features</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.6</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Drying Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.2</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Overall Look</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3.3</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0.5><li readability=-1><p>The dryer’s powerful airflow was able to quickly dry our strands.</p></li><li readability=0><p>Its centrally-located buttons made it easy for righties and lefties to switch between speed and heat levels.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Just one use of this dryer enhanced the natural shine and vibrancy of our hair.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Drying your hair can be tedious for people with any hair type, but no one knows the struggle more than someone with thick tresses. However, the BabylissPRO Porcelain Ceramic Carrera2 was a superstar when it came to drying our voluminous hair (and it cut the time down significantly). This powerful dryer was a game-changer in the mornings when we needed our hair done quickly, shortening the dry time sometimes completely in half on several hair types, from 1B to 4B. We liked how ergonomic this tool was and how its cord wasn’t unruly or too short, allowing us to walk around the bathroom as we styled our hair. Another plus was this dryer’s ambidextrous buttons, which are centrally located and easy for right-handed and left-handed people to access without accidentally switching the settings.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Though it was very easy to work our magic with this dryer, we wished it was a tad lighter, as many of the others we tested had a more weightless feel. However, we never experienced wrist or arm pain when using this dryer, so perhaps we’re just being picky. Ultimately, our locks came out looking vibrant and sleek (and most importantly, they dried quickly despite the thickness). If you have fuller hair, don’t work harder for your hair dryer — make that tool work harder for you.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Hair Type: </strong>All | <strong>Weight:</strong> 2.25 lbs. | <strong>Wattage: </strong>1900 | <strong>Settings: </strong>3 heat / 2 speed / cool shot | <strong>Attachments: </strong>Concentrator</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-thin-hair-babylisspro-nano-titanium-dryer></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for Thin Hair</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>BaBylissPRO Nano Titanium Dryer</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="BaBylissPRO Nano Titanium Dryer" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/stK0PIcAeTHk0FFLP2xY5Y5sIzI=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/babylisspro-nano-titanium-dryer-8afb985b167f4d4686d5d1055795f11d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3.9</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Features</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Drying Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.2</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Overall Look</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.3</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=2.5><li readability=1><p>It was easy to handle, maneuver, and use the buttons on this tool while styling our hair.</p></li><li readability=0><p>The airflow was a dependable, strong stream that wasn’t overly loud or distracting.</p></li><li readability=1><p>We were able to achieve full, bouncy curls despite our long, fine strands.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It’s not a walk in the park for people with thin hair to get a good blowout (and forget a voluminous one), even after plying their tresses with revitalizing <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>shampoos for thinning hair</a>. However, the BaBylissPRO Nano Titanium Dryer delivers impressive blowouts with volume, curls, and more for you beauties with fine hair. This hair dryer’s high torque motor and powerful 2,000 watts of power make this a machine that can cut through the noise (without being irritatingly loud) to leave you with a blowout that’s sleek and shiny in record time, despite hair density.

We found ourselves wishing that the cord was a little longer so we could get closer to the mirror, flip our hair around, and do all the gymnastics needed to get a full blowout. But luckily we didn’t need all of that when it came to this specific model, as we secured a bouncy, curly style in a little over 20 minutes that left our thin hair looking extra glam.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Hair Type: </strong>All | <strong>Weight:</strong> 1.92 lbs. | <strong>Wattage: </strong>2000 | <strong>Settings: </strong>3 heat / 2 speed / cool shot | <strong>Attachments:</strong> Concentrator</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-natural-hair-pattern-blow-dryer></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for Natural Hair</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Pattern Blow Dryer</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="PATTERN Blow Dryer" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/Ffwk50fFXhptRRv_E67WJPO3E9k=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/PATTERN-Blow-Dryer-5cca5ee5fe484dbf8c265e30351314de.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ulta</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Features</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Drying Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Overall Look</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=2><li readability=-1><p>This dryer accentuated and added shine to our testers’ ringlets.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>It’s very easy to maneuver thanks to its slim body and easy-to-grip handle.</p></li><li readability=3><p>The tool comes with several attachments depending on if you want to style, stretch, diffuse, or pick your hair.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Gone are the days when blow-drying your hair meant straightening it. Instead, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Tracee Ellis Ross’ breakout haircare brand Pattern</a>, has created the ideal hair dryer for accentuating natural curls and celebrating the hair you were born with. Our expert stylists raved about how easy it was to grip and work with this soft brown-hued tool, from the slim handle and setting switches to its four styling attachments: a diffuser, wide tooth comb, brush, and concentrator nozzle. We appreciated its strong airflow yet moderate temperature, which worked well with our testers’ curls and helped mold them into their natural shape rather than causing frizz. Though we tested this dryer on various curl types, we even noticed sleek and enhanced texture on 4C coils, further proving the curl-protecting prowess of the Pattern Blow Dryer.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-57 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We did think that this tool felt a little heavy in our hands, especially after styling our hair with the several (yet incredibly useful) attachments, which we used to diffuse, pick, stretch, and style our testers’ coils. It’s worth noting that this is not the best tool for straightening your hair, but it does its job phenomenally when drying natural curls. So if you want an everyday look that doesn’t involve straightening, this is your dryer — and we think it's worth every bit of its higher-end price tag.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-58 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Hair Type: </strong>Curly, coily | <strong>Weight:</strong> 1.12 lbs. | <strong>Wattage: </strong>1875 | <strong>Settings: </strong>3 heat / 2 speed / cool shot | <strong>Attachments: </strong>Diffuser, wide tooth comb, brush, concentrator nozzle</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-frizz-bondiboost-sonic-dryer></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for Frizz</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>BondiBoost Sonic Dryer</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="BondiBoost Sonic Dryer" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/ywNCFMmbvgBqos_HTDOeRazYtIw=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Bondi-Boost-Sonic-Dryer-712594efeb1a45e5999800b30a9a1715.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Bondi Boost</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Features</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.7</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Drying Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Overall Look</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.9</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0.5><li readability=0><p>This dryer worked quickly to dry our hair, even on its lowest heat setting.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>The machine itself was extremely lightweight and easy to move around thanks to its compact design.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Its advanced ion technology visibly smoothed our strands and controlled frizz.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-63 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We know the feeling of drying our hair and getting poofy results all too well, but you can kiss your frizzy strands goodbye with the BondiBoost Sonic Hair Dryer.

The dryer was light as air, clocking in under 1 lbs. and moving effortlessly with every flick of our wrists. We noticed that it could dry our hair very quickly across hair types, even at its lowest heat setting (great for less heat damage).&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-65 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We did think its switchable heat and speed settings were a little confusing, as the BondiBoost features a smart memory function that remembers your pre-selected settings to replicate your style every time. If you’re set in your ways, you may love this feature, but if you need to switch it up, this could involve a bit of a learning curve. However, we thought this machine produced some of our smoothest results, so we weren’t dissuaded by these unconventional features.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-66 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Hair Type: </strong>All | <strong>Weight:</strong> 0.77 lbs. | <strong>Wattage: </strong>1875 | <strong>Settings: </strong>4 heat / 3 speed / cool shot / smart memory | <strong>Attachments: </strong>Concentrator, diffuser</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-shine-hot-tools-turbo-ceramic-ionic-dryer></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for Shine</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Hot Tools Ceramic Ionic Dryer</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Hot Tools Turbo Ceramic Ionic Dryer" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/GIY8hgexd9uX-kUiaCYBELH1rdI=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/hot-tools-turbo-ceramic-ionic-dryer-2079aaa20f664a998f33ee5407de90a2.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=-1><p>We thought this tool was reasonably priced for the high quality results it delivered.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>This model was great at tackling the tough job of drying long hair.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>We were left with frizz-free and shiny strands by the end of this test.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-70 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Who doesn’t love an extra dose of shine sans heavy hair products?

The box comes with a diffuser, comb attachment, and concentrator nozzle — a stunning amount of extras for a tool that performs this well. After just four and a half minutes, we had half of our long hair completely dry, which was record timing for us.

But if aesthetics aren’t top of mind (besides for your hair, of course), it’s a minor complaint that should be overlooked for this hair dryer’s amazing price and even better blowouts.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-73 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Hair Type: </strong>All | <strong>Weight:</strong> 1 lb. | <strong>Wattage: </strong>1875 | <strong>Settings: </strong>3 heat / 3 speed / cool shot | <strong>Attachments:</strong> Diffuser, comb, concentrator nozzle</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-41 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=2667 data-sizes=750px alt="Hot Tools Turbo Ceramic Ionic Dryer and accessories on a marble counter." data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/LZ9_mA8dv3o6bz61u4rJ9yqFkhA=/fit-in/1500x2667/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/PEO-Hot-Tools-Professional-Turbo-Ceramic--Ionic-Lightweight-Dryer-leticia-almeida-photo-0022-470dd418ce1d4be9a2899e8a324d4dc1.jpeg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Leticia Almeida</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=2667 data-sizes=750px alt="Hot Tools Turbo Ceramic Ionic Dryer and accessories on a marble counter." data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/vbfME447pJlENiPs_n8OqkZbPqw=/fit-in/1500x2667/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/INS-hot-tools-professional-turbo-ceramicionic-lightweight-dryer-0217-4b76e0a04bd741fcba8b047a4e4a4640.jpeg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle / Jhett Thompson</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-damaged-hair-chi-lava-hair-dryer></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for Damaged Hair</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Chi Hair Dryer</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Chi Lava Hair Dryer" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/lL9TIJCJ1CS1D78j3tOWlYIHJyM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Chi-Lava-Hair-Dryer-065353060b6c40e389e64d66de0f8253.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ulta</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1.5><li readability=1><p>Its ceramic stone and volcanic rock heater emits a gentler airflow that works effectively, yet less roughly on sensitive hair.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>This stout dryer is compact enough to be easily packed away in a weekender bag or suitcase.</p></li><li readability=0><p>It contains a long cord for those hard-to-reach outlets and crazy arm movements we’re all guilty of.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-78 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Let’s face it, everyone’s hair has at least a bit of damage that could benefit from a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>hair mask</a> treatment now and then. Everyone also needs a hair dryer that can fit their needs, and heat- or dye-damaged hair is no exception.

It also includes a nice long cord so you can easily plug-in to even hard-to-reach outlets.</p><p>We wished the price were a little lower, as it has pretty standard settings (low, medium, and high heat, plus a cool shot), but we can understand its price tag is due to its volcanic and ceramic materials. All in all, we appreciated this dryer for damaged hair due to its built-in protection and add-on attachments that can be utilized for an even gentler dry — but at the end of the day, this sleek machine can be used for any hair type that needs a more mellow styling process.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-80 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Hair Type: </strong>All | <strong>Wattage: </strong>Unlisted | <strong>Settings: </strong>3 heat / cold shot | <strong>Attachments:</strong> Smoothing comb, air concentrator, diffuser&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-quiet-hot-tools-pro-artist-quietair-power-dryer></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Quiet</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Hot Tools Pro Artist QuietAir Power Dryer</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Hot Tools Pro Artist QuietAir Power Dryer" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/1OvVE0oIbt5LbhEQmDNcJXjgxQs=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Hot-Tools-Pro-Artist-QuietAir-Power-Dryer-25bf12e6fc174b4eb8662b40cd0e1302.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Hot Tools</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Features</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.3</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Drying Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Overall Look</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3.9</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1><li readability=-1><p>It has a specialty motor that produces a powerful airflow.</p></li><li readability=1><p>It effectively dried, smoothed, and styled our hair in a short amount of time.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Its incredibly lightweight feel and centrally-located buttons made this model very user-friendly.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-84 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re often tiptoeing around your house in the early hours to get ready for the day, you probably cringe at the whoosh of a hair dryer. We were pleased to discover that the QuietAir dryer from Hot Tools was so hushed that we could simultaneously watch our favorite shows without turning on subtitles (a huge win in our book). Its specialty motor is guaranteed to produce powerful airflow while remaining 30 percent quieter than the standard hair dryer, making this essential for everyday life.

Its lowest speed was good enough to get our hair, from type 1B to type 4B curls, dry within 20 minutes. Our strands were smooth and shiny in no time thanks to its internal ionic generator, which helps control our natural frizz and gives us salon-quality shine. Another standout feature was its cord, which was long enough that we could move around the bathroom without having to unplug. It also felt sturdy enough to last a few years without fraying or creasing.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-93 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While we adored this dryer for its small stature and lightweight feel, we did think its short handle made it a little too easy to switch button settings accidentally. The buttons were also placed for right-handed users, making this a little tough for lefties, but it was still easy to accidentally hit the cool shot instead of a higher heat due to their proximity. However, after spending more time with the dryer, we got the hang of the handle’s quirks. If you’re searching for a light hair dryer for your gym bag and want something a little smaller and easier to store, the DigitalAire is perfect for you.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-94 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Hair Type: </strong>All | <strong>Weight:</strong> 1.2 lbs. | <strong>Wattage: </strong>1875 | <strong>Settings: </strong>3 heat / 3 speed / cool shot | <strong>Attachments: </strong>Concentrator, diffuser</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-ionic-rusk-w8less-professional-2000-watt-dryer></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Ionic</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Rusk W8less Professional 2000 Watt Dryer</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Rusk W8less Professional 2000 Watt Dryer" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/e2EjWsSJlvJEcayn7Zee1aOtLlc=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Rusk-W8less-Professional-2000-Watt-Dryer-3c0a243e50f94830b41982b83928c407.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.1</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Features</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Drying Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.3</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Overall Look</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=-1><p>This dryer effectively reduced our frizz thanks to its ceramic and tourmaline ionic technology.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>The price was much more digestible than some others on this list (without sacrificing quality).</p></li><li readability=-1><p>It was easy and intuitive to use this simply designed tool.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-98 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The RuskEngineering W8less dryer features a powerful 2000-watt ionic generator that quickly gave us sleek and shiny strands. Thanks to its advanced ionic technology, this ceramic and tourmaline-infused hair dryer eliminated frizz from root to end. Not only did we see silkier strands, but we felt how easy it was to twist and turn this tool around our heads due to its barely-there weight and nine-foot cord, which let us wander around our bathrooms as we dried. And if you ask us, the price is one of the better parts of this tool — where most dryers ring in at a much higher price, this simple but high-quality machine has a reasonable price point.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-99 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While we loved so many things about this quick-drying tool, we did think that it tended to run a little too hot — especially on the hottest setting and type 4 hair. Since this type of hair is often drier than others, it can be more sensitive to heat, so we wouldn’t recommend using this high setting on porous or dry hair. In the same grain, we wish this tool was more inclusive with its attachments (such as adding a diffuser), as it’s only sold with a concentrator, which is better for non-curly hair.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-100 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Hair Type: </strong>All | <strong>Weight:</strong> 1 lb. | <strong>Wattage: </strong>2000 | <strong>Settings: </strong>3 heat / 2 speed / cool shot | <strong>Attachment: </strong>Concentrator</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-travel-t3-afar-travel-size-hair-dryer></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for Travel</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>T3 Afar Travel Size Hair Dryer</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="T3 Afar Lightweight Travel Size Hair Dryer" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/wRfqNjBM5_IKthi4cpGDkaaToKM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/bloomingdales-t3-afar-lightweight-travel-size-hair-dryer-b31b4f2785f841038b5f2aa1060d3a25.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Bloomingdale's</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.7</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Features</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.7</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Drying Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Overall Look</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.3</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0.5><li readability=0><p>Its petite size is said to be 20 percent lighter and 30 percent smaller than your average hair dryer.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>The tool’s compact body makes it very lightweight — our arms and wrists never felt fatigued.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Our strands were significantly smoother and softer after using this tool.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-105 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">You’ve got your passport and your suitcase ready to go, but why do you feel like you’re forgetting something? Probably because you’re missing the T3 Afar — a sleek, compact tool made for jet-setters who know they can do better than the hotel hair dryer. We loved this dryer’s foldable handle, which makes it easier to pack into a suitcase or carry-on before jumping in the car. Though it’s a bit lighter and smaller than your average hair dryer, it still functions in the same way as a normal model — complete with three heat levels, two speed settings, and a style-securing cool shot.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-106 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Our strands looked and felt sleeker and softer than ever when we used this tool, and we found that it got hot enough to effectively dry our hair without making us worry about heat damage. It even performed well on those of us with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>hair extensions</a>, smoothing and drying both our natural strands and our false ones at the same time. Plus, it was incredibly lightweight — our arms and wrists never felt tired while we worked away at our hair.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-107 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While we thoroughly enjoyed using this dryer and the concentrator nozzle it came with, we were curious as to how it would perform with a diffuser on curlier textures if we wanted to dry our hair curly and not straight. Fortunately, there is a diffuser attachment that you can buy from T3 — but it’s sold separately, so you would have to add that on top of this already-pricey tool. Still, we can’t imagine going back to hotel hair dryers after our maiden voyage with this one.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-108 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Hair Type: </strong>All | <strong>Weight:</strong> 0.76 lbs. | <strong>Wattage: </strong>1500 | <strong>Settings: </strong>3 heat / 2 speed / cold shot | <strong>Attachments: </strong>Concentrator</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-hot-air-brush-shark-hyperair-hair-dryer-with-iq-2-in-1-concentrator--styling-brush></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Hot Air Brush</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Shark HyperAir Hair Dryer</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Shark HyperAir Hair Dryer" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/y9-mn4eMGt_tAXUW7VNzD03pzKA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/shark-hyperair-hair-dryer-2847d88a14bc4ace90c070c738d7104a.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Shark</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3.9</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Features</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Drying Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Overall Look</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.9</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1><li readability=1><p>Its nifty nozzles are easy to click on and use, giving us effortless blowouts with less brushes and products.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>The longer-than-usual handle makes this dryer very easy to grip.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>We think it has an excellent price for the quality of this tool.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-112 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Gone are the days when you must juggle your hair dryer and round brush to perfect your blowout because the Shark HyperAir is here to do this for you. Equipped with a hot air brush attachment and concentrator nozzle, we could style our hair easier than ever before by simply screwing on these ends. We had fun testing this sleek tool thanks to its intuitive features and bouncy results, leaving us with glamorous body and shine no matter our hair type. The buttons were easy to access thanks to their central location, and its long handle made it easier to grip this dryer than others we tested. It didn’t take long to get the effortless blowouts we wanted either, as its six powerful airflow and heat settings quickly formed our hair into sleek, professional-quality ‘dos. In fact, this one was a little friendlier on fine and natural hair than the Dyson was, though both were neck and neck in this test.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-113 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Because of its slightly longer body and thicker attachments, this dryer felt a little heavier and denser than others on this list. However, it was never cumbersome to hold the tool up as we styled our hair and we never got sore, so we’re not docking too many points for this reason. Its versatile attachments make this dryer a total competitor with the Dyson, and we think it's a good option if you don’t want to splurge so much on your hair dryer. In the end, this dryer is completely worth its price tag — we’re surprised it’s not higher.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-114 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Hair Type: </strong>All | <strong>Weight:</strong> 1.77 lbs. | <strong>Wattage: </strong>1680 | <strong>Settings: </strong>3 heat / 3 speed / cool shot | <strong>Attachments: </strong>2-in-1 concentrator, styling brush, small cleaning brush</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-we-tested-hair-dryers></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How We Tested Hair Dryers</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We take our hair dryers very seriously — so much so that we’re testing the latest and greatest that come out yearly to give you the most up-to-date info on which tools you should buy. We tested tested 21 of the newest dryers this year alone (34 total including the ones we tested in 2022) — trying them in our lab on volunteers with all types of hair, from fine and straight to thick and curly. We made sure to give each tool a fair shot by having professional hair stylists use them on our testers for the best results. Taking it a step further, we took our own metrics of each hair dryer — from the exact temperatures of each heat setting to the decibels of sound each speed level produced. We then went on to style our testers’ hair.</p><ul id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><li><strong>Hair Prep: </strong>Each volunteer came into the lab with their hair already cleaned, conditioned, and dried, to then re-wet it and style it with the hair dryer. After they got a feel for the hair dryer and the hair stylists worked their magic, the testers and experts left their thoughts on how each dryer looked, felt, and performed.</li><li><strong>At Home: </strong>But we didn’t stop there. Sure, you can get a great blowout from a professional stylist — but the true test of a hair dryer’s performance is how it works in the real world. After the lab test commenced, we sent these hair dryers home with three different testers per tool to incorporate into their beauty routines for four weeks. Each tester had varying hair types (at least one type 1, type 2 or 3, and type 4 per tool, with differing curl patterns from A to C) to understand how each hair dryer performs on all texture types.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Extended Testing: </strong>They used the hair dryers at least twice a week (besides our testers with type 3 or 4 hair, who could choose to use it once weekly), checking in at the end with their feedback to describe how each held up. Once they assessed their own hair health, they shared whether or not they thought each hair dryer was worth it. Spoiler alert: these all made the cut.</li><li><strong>Data Analysis: </strong>After all was said and done, we analyzed our testers’ data to come to a consensus on which were our winners and which were left behind. Combined with the winners we couldn’t leave behind in 2022 and our newly tested favorites from 2023, these 17 hair dryers made our PEOPLE Tested list.<br></li></ul><figure id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Tamara Staples</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-faq-774ad57f-e741-4513-ba8d-209571cfd075></span><p>Frequently Asked Questions</p><ul id=mntl-sc-block-faq__content_1-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block-faq__content mntl-accordion" readability=47.363831089351><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-0.87995337995338><p><span class=accordion__title>What is a good wattage for a hair dryer?</span></p><p>The wattage level on your hair dryer is a great indicator of how hot the blow dryer can get and how quickly it will dry your hair. For the fastest (and safest) results, 1800 to 1850 watts is the sweet spot. Many of our picks are a little higher than this mark, like the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">InfinitiPro by Conair DigitalAire</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow nocaes">Hot Tools Pro Artist QuietAir</a>, and more — all coming in at 1875 watts.&nbsp;</p><p>However, generally anything at or below 2000 watts (such as the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">RuskEngineering W8less</a>) is safe to use at home. Anything with a low wattage will take a little longer to fully dry your hair, which means our picks at 1600 watts (like the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">T3 Afar</a> or <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=5 rel="nofollow nocaes">Laifen Swift</a>) might take a bit longer to get that full blowout, but your hair may sustain less heat damage in the long run. Regardless, always use a heat protectant before you get to styling.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-0.91176470588235><p><span class=accordion__title>How much does a hair dryer cost?</span></p><p>The price of a hair dryer varies depending on the brand, materials, functionality, and attachments included with the purchase. You can nab a great-performing dryer with the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">InfinitiPro BY Conair SmoothWrap</a>, or you can splurge on higher-priced tools like the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Dyson SuperSonic</a>.</p><p>Most will usually range between $150-$200, making hair dryers somewhat of an investment for many shoppers — which means you must carefully consider before pressing the “purchase” button.

Concentrators funnel the air from the hair dryer into a targeted area, making the hair easier to manipulate for certain hairstyles (like the lovely flippy ends of a blowout).&nbsp;</p><p>Diffusers are another popular hair dryer attachment for preserving and drying natural curls and providing volume. This type of nozzle funnels the air over a wider area than the physical tool’s opening allows for, expanding the hair dryer’s reach and providing a gentler airflow than a direct blast. If you want to splurge on a hair dryer with more attachments, like the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Dyson Supersonic</a>, you can experiment with add-ons like flyaway attachments, gentle air nozzles, wide-tooth combs, and more to perfect your hair-drying routine. Applying a little <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>hair oil</a> to damp hair before styling can also nourish, add shine, and long-lasting smoothness.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-0.93294797687861><p><span class=accordion__title>Is a ceramic or ionic hair dryer better?</span></p><p>If you've ever seen the word "ionic" on a hair dryer and wondered what it meant, you're not alone. Celebrity hairstylist Renato Campora explains: "An ionic hair dryer is a type of hair dryer that has a negative ionic charge. When these negative ions react with the positive ions in your hair, it helps to close the damaged cuticles of the hair." Effectively, this helps to reduce frizz, static electricity, and flyaways.&nbsp;</p><p>Ceramic hair dryers offer different benefits. The ceramic material heats quickly and evenly and generates infrared heat to help speed up the drying process. Less time drying hair means less damage. However, if your hair is prone to frizz or flyaways, a hair dryer with ionic technology, like our best overall pick, the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Hot Tools Pro Artist Black Gold 2000 Watt Ionic Hair Dryer</a>, may be a better choice.</p></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-trust-people></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Trust PEOPLE?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Alyssa Brascia</a> has been a commerce writer for PEOPLE since 2022, with expertise in beauty research for her work with cosmetics, skincare, and haircare.
