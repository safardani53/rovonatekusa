To track the status of past participants, the network launched a spinoff, My 600-lb Life: Where Are They Now?, in 2015.</p><h2>Is My 600-lb Life real?&nbsp;</h2><p>Although there a skeptics, My 600-lb Life is as real as reality TV gets. According to past participants, filming is hard work. "So exhausting to the point that there are days that I don’t even want to film," Steven Assanti said in a Facebook video. "And I try to avoid being filmed, but the camera crew — especially one of them in particular — is so persistent that he will continue to knock on the door, and knock on the door, and knock on the door until you can’t stand it anymore….It’s just a lot of work."</p><p>Some former My 600-lb Life stars also revealed they were bullied online after their episodes aired. "I would rather seek out options before signing away the rights to my name, my life, ect. [sic]," Justin Assanti <a href=#>wrote</a> on Reddit. "I went from no one knowing I existed to being harassed all day on social media, my business, and phone calls. I wouldn't do it again."</p><h2>Does My 600-lb Life pay?&nbsp;</h2><p>Yes, but not much. According to<a href=#> some outlets</a>, show participants are reportedly paid just $4,000 and are given extra for allowing cameras to capture more personal moments, like taking showers.&nbsp;</p><p>However, due to the contracts participants sign, they are not allowed to publicly discuss their salaries from the TLC series.&nbsp;</p><h2>Who pays for the surgery on My 600-lb Life?&nbsp;</h2><p>Fans have some theories about who pays for the surgeries on My 600-lb Life, and it's not TLC. "Almost everyone who weighs that much is disabled. They most likely qualify for disability, Section 8 housing, and Medicaid," the fan wrote on <a href=#>Quora</a>.&nbsp;Medicaid coverage for bariatric surgery is determined by each state's governing body.</p><h2>My 600-lb Life Diet:</h2><p>If you're looking to lose weight, <a href=#>Dr. Now's My 600-lb Life diet plan</a> is the perfect first step. The 1,200 calorie diet is low-carb, low-fat, high-protein and encourages followers to avoid sugary snacks and drinks, as well as starchy foods like potatoes, rice, pasta, and cereal.&nbsp;</p><h2>My 600-lb Life Deaths: &nbsp;</h2><p>There have sadly been <a href=#>six deaths since the premiere of My 600-lb Life.&nbsp;</a></p><ul><li>Henry Foots —&nbsp;The Season 1 star died in 2013 from an illness unrelated to his weight issues.&nbsp;</li><li>Robert Buchel —&nbsp;Robert passed away while filming his episode during Season 6. He died of a heart attack while staying in a nursing facility in Houston.&nbsp;</li><li>James L.B. Bonner —&nbsp;Sadly, L.B. completed suicide shortly after appearing on Season 6 of the show.
