But she once mentioned during her interview with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The Star</a> in September 2010 that she was married to her partner in her 20s. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-181 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The interview also reported that LaFlamme had no children at the time.</p><h2>Who Is Lisa LaFlamme's Husband?</h2><p>Although she didn't mention anything more about her married life or ex-husband, she did speak about her motherly instinct amidst the talk about her adoration for her eight nieces and nephews.</p><p>"This is as close to motherhood as I get," LaFlamme said on her bond with her nieces and nephews. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-182 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>That being said, the television journalist does have a companion in her home&nbsp;who waits for her like a family every time she returns from work — a dog named Toby.</p><p>Other than that, she hasn't answered the fans' query of,&nbsp;"is Lisa Laflamme married?" or has&nbsp;talked about anything that can be taken into account for her possible husband, boyfriend, or her married life.</p><h2>Who Is Lisa LaFlamme?</h2><p>Born on July 25, 1964, LaFlamme is a Canadian television journalist who currently serves as the chief anchor and senior editor of CTV National News. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-183 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The Kitchener, Canada native, is also known for her role as a former news international affairs correspondent for CTV National News.</p><p>Apart from that, the 57-year-old&nbsp;was also a co-host of the Canadian breakfast television news show Canada AM from 2001 to 2003.</p><h2>Lisa LaFlamme's Salary Details</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Glassdoor</a>, the average salary of a senior editor in Canada is $66,549 yearly. And going by LaFlamme's experience in the field, it is inevitable that she earns more than the average salary.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-629 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Therefore, there's no doubt that she also has amassed a healthy net worth, although she has not revealed the figures yet.&nbsp;</p><p>LaFlamme initially started her <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">career</a> as a copywriter and script assistant at CKCO, CTV's Kitchener affiliate, in 1988 and eventually moved to become an anchor in 1997.</p><p>The anchor joined CTV National News as a foreign correspondent in 2003. She was also a backup anchor to Lloyd Robertson. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-185 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>During her contribution to CTV, she covered several international conflicts and events, like the 9/11 attacks, Hurricane Katrina, the death of Pope John Paul II in 2005, and the election of Pope Francis in 2013.</p><p>On top of that, LaFlamme has also covered every Canadian Federal Election since 1997, not forgetting to mention the Diamond Jubilee of <a href=# rel=follow>Queen Elizabeth II</a> in 2012 and the royal wedding of Catherine Middleton and Prince William in 2011.</p><p>Among numerous accolades, she was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">named</a>&nbsp;'Best News Anchor National' at the 2014 'Canadian Screen Awards.' <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-623 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGiknpyZlnyttdKaZKWZlqGurrnEZqSaqqKesqV5x66qm5memXqmusaanp6cXp3Brrg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./red-dirt-singer-jake-flint-dead.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jake Flint dead at 37: Oklahoma Red Dirt country singer dies only hours after his wedding as bride s</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./clarence-sutton-american-football.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Fame | Clarence Sutton (American football) net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-offensive-t-shirts-that-have-been-removed-from-stores.html>15 Most Offensive T-Shirts Ever</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./extreme-makeover-jillian-harris-edition.html>Extreme Makeover: Jillian Harris Edition!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lizzy-mcalpine-tour-2022-how-buy-tickets.html>Lizzy McAlpine tour 2022: How can I buy tickets?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nichole-lynel.html>Nichole Lynel</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./teddy-afro.html>Teddy Afro</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 LoopBlog.
