According to court records, this action was done because of the duo’s irreconcilable disagreements. The couple divorced on July 31 and had no children together. In the filings, Robin said, “Pursuant to the couples’ post-nuptial agreement, all assets are his/her separate property.” Wright has also opted to prevent the court from granting the couple spousal support. Wright and Giraudet have yet to comment on the matter, and further information is still required.</p><h2>Robin Wright’s ex-boyfriend works as a VIP relations manager at Saint Laurent Paris.</h2><p>Clement Giraudet is a VIP relations manager at Saint Laurent Paris, where he previously worked as a shop director. He has collaborated with well-known labels including Balmain, Longchamp, and Dior. The 37-year-old enrolled at the University of Bedfordshire to study Business Administration. He subsequently attended EDC Paris Business School to get his MBA, majoring in Luxury Brand Management and International Marketing. He graduated from Emlylon Business School with a Master’s degree. Robin Wright and Clement Giraudet allegedly met at a Saint Laurent fashion show in Paris in 2017 and made their first public appearance together during a soccer game the same year. Three months later, Page Six announced that the couple was dating.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Robin-Wright-1.jpg alt="Robin Wright" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>In August 2018, the couple exchanged vows in a private ceremony. A source told People that the ceremony was modest and low-key and that Wright wanted the wedding to be about them rather than a huge show. The couple continued to appear in public on several occasions. Last year, Wright and Giraudet were photographed sunbathing on a Los Angeles beach. Following their marriage, they had a holiday in Italy in 2018 before heading to Ibiza for their honeymoon the following year.</p><h2>Robin Wright’s dating history</h2><p>Robin Wright initially married Dane Witherspoon in 1986 and they were married from 1986 until 1988. In 1989, she was romantically connected to actor Sean Penn, and the couple married in 1996.&nbsp;They had an on-again, off-again romance. This resulted in divorce in 2010.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Robin-Wright-2.jpg alt="Robin Wright" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Dylan Frances, who was born in April 1991, and Hopper Jack, who was born in August 1993, are the couple’s two children. Wright began dating actor Ben Foster in February 2012, after their divorce was completed, and they married in January 2014. They broke up the same year, then reunited in 2015, only to separate again later that year.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGipqJqZo3q4vsign61llp65prCMn6arZZFisarCzquanmWWp7yueceeqWagpaivorrDZpqlnZ2au7V5xqKpmq2UmsFw</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./what-happened-to-doc-street-outlaws.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What Happened to Doc on 'Street Outlaws'?
