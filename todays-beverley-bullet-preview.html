Mr Lupton (4-1) - Richard Fahey/Paul Hanagan</h2><p>Classy colt who has won several big sprints over the past couple of seasons.</p><p>Often produces his best form at York, where he finished ninth in the Nunthorpe last time.</p><p>Was behind <strong>Take Cover</strong> that day, but this is more his level so should run a good race.</p><h2>2. Final Venture (7-2) - Paul Midgley/Luke Morris</h2><p>Ran a cracker to finish second to <strong>Take Cover</strong> in this contest 12 months ago.</p><p>Put a disappointing effort at Hamilton behind him when just touched off at York last time.</p><p>Has a good draw in five and looks sure to be involved in the finish once again.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Paul Midgley on Final Venture</h3></p><p>"Final Venture ran great at York last week when a second to El Astronaute, who has been terrifc all year.</p><p>"It was annoying to get beat, but he's come out of it really well and goes to Beverley with a big old shout.</p><p>"On the ratings, he's not a million miles away.</p><h2>3. Foolaad (25-1) - Roy Bowring/Lewis Edmunds</h2><p>Made a winning return at Pontefract in April but has been below par on his last few starts.</p><p>Has been well drawn in stall three but first-time cheekpieces need to spark significant improvement.</p><p>Looks up against it on first start at Listed level.</p><h2>4. Line Of Reason (16-1) - Paul Midgley/Joe Fanning</h2><p>Has a good record at Beverley and was narrowly denied in this race by<strong> Maarek</strong> in 2015.</p><p>His form has been hit and miss this season, with a good run at Ascot followed by a flop at York most recently.</p><p>Capable of playing a leading role at decent odds if on a going day.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Paul Midgley on Line Of Reason</h3></p><p>"Line Of Reason has run so many good races, but he has annoyingly only won once at track.</p><p>"To be fair, he's bumped into a few good ones over the years and occasionally the ground has gone against him.</p><p>"He loves it at Beverley and is as hard as nails."</p><h2>5. Mirza (12-1) - Rae Guest/Nicky Mackay</h2><p>Very smart sprinter back in the day, winning twice at Group 3 level.</p><p>Now an 11-year-old and still capable of good form, including when solid sixth in French Listed race last time.</p><p>A suspicion he will find one or two too strong here, though.</p><h2>6. Mythmaker (8-1) - Bryan Smart/Graham Lee</h2><p>Won well at Haydock in July and not disgraced in a Group 3 last time out.</p><p>Doesn't have the experience of this course that some of his rivals can boast.</p><p>However, trainer and jockey combined to win the Nunthorpe last week and he has the plum draw in stall one.</p><h2>7. Take Cover (11-4) - David Griffiths/David Allan</h2><p>Tough-as-teak veteran who continues to run to a high level of form at the age of 11.</p><p>Ran a cracker to finish second to Battaash at Goodwood and ran a good sixth in the Nunthorpe latest.</p><p>Won this race last year and looks the one to beat again despite slightly tricky draw in nine.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">David Griffiths on Take Cover</h3></p><p>"He won it nicely last year and ran a cracker at York last time.</p><p>"He came out of the Nunthorpe really well and looks as good as ever at home.</p><p>"He's the class horse in the race. He's proven at this level and in Group company, with his second at Goodwood in the King George probably as good a run as he's ever produced without winning.</p><p>"He brings the best form into the race and it would be lovely to see him get his nose in front again in a big race like this.</p><p>"Everything has gone well this week and he's as fit as we can have him. We are going to Beverley very confident."</p><h2>8. Tanasoq (20-1) - Paul Midgley/James Sullivan</h2><p>Rattled up a four-timer earlier in the season, with his four victories including the Dash at Epsom.</p><p>Ran a rare poor race at York last time but that performance is easily excused.</p><p>Has the widest draw to overcome but could hit the frame if getting luck in running.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Paul Midgley on Tanasoq</h3></p><p>"Tanasoq has been brilliant for us this year. It's there in black and white what he's done.</p><p>"He's got a big engine and is a very fresh horse.</p><p>"It's been disappointing not to have won the Bullet before, but hopefully our luck can change."</p><h2>9. Elnadim Star (8-1) - Kevin Ryan/Kevin Stott</h2><p>Progressive three-year-old sprinter has won twice over this course and distance.</p><p>Ran out a cosy winner of a Listed race at Ayr last time, coming home in a good time.</p><p>This is a deeper race so she will need to step forward again, but she is more than capable of doing so.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Bruce Raymond on Elnadim Star</h3></p><p>"It's obviously going to be a tough race as there are a lot of older, smart horses in there, but she has won twice already at Beverley.</p><p>"We know she likes the course, and the ground is also going to be fine for her.</p><p>"Jaber (Abdullah, owner) likes to take things step by step with his horses and not to aim too high, too soon, but it will be interesting to see how she gets on."</p><h2>10. Short Call (50-1) - Rebecca Menzies/Shane Gray</h2><p>Made a winning debut in a three-runner race at Goodwood in June last year.</p><p>Finished third at Bath after that and not seen since.</p><p>Having her first start for Rebecca Menzies, but this looks a tall order.</p><h2>11. Tricksy Spirit (33-1) - Mick Channon/Scott McCullagh</h2><p>Useful filly finished second in a Listed race at Sandown earlier this year.</p><p>Has struggled to repeat that form since and ran poorly in a Goodwood handicap last time.</p><p>Hard to fancy in this company.</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Blue Point and Battaash feature in stellar entries for QIPCO British Champions Sprint Stakes</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZLWwvtKeqZqbmaO0cIOQbWtuamlkwbCwwLKqZpqVq7KzuMSyZJutnKGytXnPq5yvoZWsfA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./soldier-dies-army-training-camp.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Urgent probe launched after soldier dies at army training camp as colleagues share their 'immense sa</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./john-blackwell-jr-prince-drummer-dead-at-43.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Prince's Former Drummer John Blackwell Jr. Dead at 43</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-offensive-t-shirts-that-have-been-removed-from-stores.html>15 Most Offensive T-Shirts Ever</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./extreme-makeover-jillian-harris-edition.html>Extreme Makeover: Jillian Harris Edition!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lizzy-mcalpine-tour-2022-how-buy-tickets.html>Lizzy McAlpine tour 2022: How can I buy tickets?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nichole-lynel.html>Nichole Lynel</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./teddy-afro.html>Teddy Afro</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 LoopBlog.
