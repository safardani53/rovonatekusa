I did what I felt was right,” Taylor, 64, tells PEOPLE in this week’s issue. “This is that kind of time where you have to persist and think differently and take care of those that are with you and lift everyone’s spirits and march forward.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For starters, Taylor donated his yearly salary and bonus, totaling more than $800,000 — and even as business has slowed amid the shutdown, the company has so far not had to lay anyone off or cut pay.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>For more companies with heart, pick up the latest issue of PEOPLE, on newsstands Friday, or <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>subscribe here</a>.</strong></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Kent Taylor.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy Texas Roadhouse</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He also contributed another $5 million to an emergency fund called Andy’s Outreach, which he set up for his employees 18 years ago to help with things like rent and mortgage payments, utility bills and funeral expenses.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“We were doing that to take care of our people that might have a loved one die that needed money for a funeral or an operation,” he explains of its origins. “It would transition to where people gave part of their paycheck, whether 10 cents of $10, to help our people during times of need.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Taylor says he noticed that many of his workers were looking to the fund for help, and that its funds were quickly getting depleted, which prompted him to donate millions of his own.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I’m 64 years old and I call people under 55 kids. So I have 70,000 kids, and you want to take care of them,” he says of his employees. “I relate it to my own personal family and I want to take care of my family, is how I look at it.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Taylor knows what it is to struggle, and his experiences are a big part of the reason why he feels a push to help others; during the early days of Texas Roadhouse in the early 1990s, Taylor was a single parent raising two daughters, and had to lean on his parents for financial support and, at times, housing.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“When you’re down and out, that sticks in your head,” he says. “A lot of people think when you make it later in life it leaves, but it stays in your brain. Later in life you want to give back in the same way.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">So far, Taylor says the response to his efforts has been great, and that he’s received hundreds of thank you letters – some of which have even made him shed a few tears.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The businessman — whose company is based in Louisville, Kentucky — says that when all is said and done, he hopes his generosity will be something his employees take with them.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I want them,” he says, “to transfer the love we’re showing them to other people.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ5iquqK6jKKlrZ2imsC1e9Oer5qrXae8orDHqKysnV2YsrB5yp6lrWWklsatu9FmnpqulWKuuK3YZqqapJGnxm6uzqesrGWfm3p5fI%2BkZKGdnKV6prnPpaaynZWoerGtzZ2cpqGTZA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./hannah-denhartigh.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Hannah DenHartigh- Net Worth, Boyfriend, Height, Bio, Age, Nationality, Career</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./bam-bam-bigelow-19610901-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Bam Bam Bigelow (Wrestler) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-offensive-t-shirts-that-have-been-removed-from-stores.html>15 Most Offensive T-Shirts Ever</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./extreme-makeover-jillian-harris-edition.html>Extreme Makeover: Jillian Harris Edition!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lizzy-mcalpine-tour-2022-how-buy-tickets.html>Lizzy McAlpine tour 2022: How can I buy tickets?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nichole-lynel.html>Nichole Lynel</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./teddy-afro.html>Teddy Afro</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 LoopBlog.
