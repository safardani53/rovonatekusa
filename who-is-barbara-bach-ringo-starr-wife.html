In a 1981 interview with Playboy, Bach shared that the couple faced a lot of negative press when they first began dating. She also didn't expect to meet someone she would want to marry.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We both had the same philosophy, neither one ever wanting to marry again," she said. "Richard already has three children, aged 10 to 13. Quite honestly, I never thought I'd be so lucky, to fall so much in love that I'd want to do the whole thing over. My family was shocked."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 1981, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Bach and Starr got married</a> in London and the pair have been together ever since.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Bach and Starr share a mutual love for fashion. In December 2022, photos obtained by the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Daily Mail</a> spotted the couple on a shopping spree at Moncler in London.

"A lot of garbage has been written about us, none of it interesting," she said. "The truth is, we weren't together until the very end of Caveman. Working, we got along fine, but we each had other people, our respective friends. Then, all of a sudden, within a week — the last week of shooting — it just happened.

"We decided we <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>wouldn't spend any time apart</a>," Starr said.
