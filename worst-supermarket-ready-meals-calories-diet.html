According to Rob Hobson, a nutritionist and author of <a href=#>Unprocess Your Life</a>, the supermarket you buy your ready meal from can actually make a difference to the quality of the dish.</p><p>"Obviously they are fairly similar but there are differences especially when price is concerned," he says.</p><p>"Cheaper varieties can be a lot more ultra processed and, as such, contain a lot more additives.</p><p>"But this sometimes means they may contain less fat, for example, as an emulsifier has been used in its place."</p><p>Rob adds: "The ‘taste the difference’ versions of dishes are also sometimes less healthy as they tend to be more indulgent with more cheese, cream or richer spaces making them high in calories, sat fat and salt."</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Diet & Fitness</h2></p><p>Opting for homemade meals tends to be a better option, if you have the time.</p><p>"Using fresh ingredients means you can make your dishes more nutritious and control the amount of saturated fat, salt and sugar," explains Rob.</p><p>"You can also tweak recipes to add more veggies or switch to the whole grain variety of a food.</p><p>"Aside from all of this, you can also ensure your dish doesn’t contain any of the ingredients you wouldn’t find in your kitchen cupboards which is characteristic of ultra processed foods that have been shown to have a negative impact on health.</p><p>"Everything tastes much better when you make it fresh."</p><p>Still fancy picking up a supermarket ready meal?</p><p>You might want to give these calorie packed options a miss if you’re watching your waistline.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>1.

Although a carby, cheesy, meaty pizza can offer a satisfying meal, Rob says that there’s not much to be said on the health front for a pizza.</p><p>"It is high in calories, sat and saturated fat which is down to the combination of bread, cheese and toppings such as pepperoni," he explains.</p><p>He adds: "If making your own pizza from scratch is a bit of a faff then you could try making tortilla pizza?</p><p>"You can make flour tortillas yourself using just flour and water and these can be frozen so you have them batch cooked and ready to go in the freezer.</p><p>"Then you just top with a base of passata, chopped garlic and oregano then top with a little cheese, chopped red pepper and even an egg on top."</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Pizza to go?
