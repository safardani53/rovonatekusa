A Santa Clarita, California, couple are fighting back after their 6-year-old foster daughter,<b> </b>Lexi, was taken away on Monday, March 21, because she’s 1/64 Choctaw Native American.</p><p>Lexi now lives with her extended family in Utah. <i><a href=#>KTLA</a> </i>reports that her birth parents haven’t been in contact with the child for years because of incarceration and addiction. Lexi’s court-appointed attorney reportedly said that her relatives in Utah have been waiting for her for three years.</p><p>Rusty and Summer Page, Lexi’s foster parents, opened up exclusively to<i> Us Weekly</i> about the harrowing situation they say the Indian Child Welfare Act, which prefers to keep Indian children with their American Indian families, has put them through.</p><p><img decoding=async src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt width=1000 height=818 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><span>“I am feeling lost, angry, exhausted, sick and helpless. I am feeling like I am falling short of my solemn promise to be Lexi’s Superman — that no matter how many hours I work, or thousands of emails I send, Lexi isn’t home yet,” Rusty tells </span><i>Us</i><span>. “I feel sorrow for Lexi, my children and my wife. I ache when I see them crying — and it hurts.”</span></p><p>The Pages, who began to foster Lexi four years ago, have three biological children — <b>Maddie</b>, <b>Zoey </b>and <b>Caleb</b>. “They are struggling in their own way,” Rusty tells <i>Us </i>of his kids. “Every time the doorbell rings, our youngest, Zoey, comes running to the top of our landing exuberantly crying, ‘Lexi’s <i>home!</i>‘ We are trying to distract them as much as possible, and friends have been so gracious to help.”</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"></p><p>Rusty is determined to bring Lexi home, but the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services has cut off his family’s communication with her.</p><p>“Despite the ‘promise’ by L.A. County DCFS and the family in Utah, we have not been able to speak with her at all,” Rusty claims. “We have no idea where she laid her head down the last few nights, and that is why I simply cannot lay my head down.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p><span>Rusty says that he has petitioned elected officials and has filed for emergency relief from the California Supreme Court. He also hopes that his community and more will share their petition and </span><a href=#>Facebook page.</a></p><p>“Lexi was a beautiful, happy, sweet little girl,” Rusty gushes to <i>Us</i>. “Having our own personal dance parties was a favorite way to spend time together.”</p><p>Lexi also had plenty of fun with her foster mom. “She had beautiful long hair and loved to have a side braid and pretend she was Elsa [from <i>Frozen</i>],” Summer tells <i>Us.</i>&nbsp;“She loved to hear me say, ‘Lexi, I love you to the moon and back.'”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGafmZ2eubp50qmcmqOjYry2wIyana2domKzsL%2FTnqlmnJGqtKnAxKtkoqtdp7Kuu9Wem2aalZiutr%2FEZqafZZiav26%2BwJycZq9iZX1yfJRo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./summer-houses-luke-knew-about-craig-kristin-cavallari-hookup.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Summer Houses Luke Knew About Craig, Kristin Cavallari Hookup</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./dallas-drupee-young.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Dallas Drupee Young Height, Age, Net Worth, Brother, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-offensive-t-shirts-that-have-been-removed-from-stores.html>15 Most Offensive T-Shirts Ever</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./extreme-makeover-jillian-harris-edition.html>Extreme Makeover: Jillian Harris Edition!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lizzy-mcalpine-tour-2022-how-buy-tickets.html>Lizzy McAlpine tour 2022: How can I buy tickets?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nichole-lynel.html>Nichole Lynel</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./teddy-afro.html>Teddy Afro</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 LoopBlog.
