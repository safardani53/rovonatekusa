People born in the year of the snake are idealists. They may appear frigid on the outside, but on the inside, they are warm and eager. Their yearning for sole possession is intense. It irritates them when they don't fully comprehend someone. Snakes are dedicated and determined, but their greatest adversary is lethargy.</p><p>People born on July 1 have a zodiac sign of <strong>Cancer</strong>. Cancer, as represented by the crab, smoothly glides between sea and beach, symbolizing cancer's capacity to dwell in both emotional and material realms. Cancers are extremely perceptive, and their psychic powers materialize in physical settings. However, like the hard-shelled crabs, this water sign is eager to go to any length to defend itself emotionally. You'll need to build trust in order to get to know this sign!</p><p>Known best for his starring role in the 1971 film Walkabout, this Australian aboriginal actor also played major roles in the films The Last Wave and Storm Boy, as well as in the 2008 Baz Luhrmann movie Australia.
