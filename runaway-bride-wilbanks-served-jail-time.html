In addition, in 1998, Wilbanks served jail time for shoplifting. Documents state that Wilbanks, now 32, was charged with shoplifting $1,740 in merchandise from a Gainesville mall. Felony charges reportedly were dropped after she completed a pretrial diversion program, which included 75 hours of community service and restitution. In the other case, Wilbanks served two weekends in jail after pleading guilty to shoplifting $98 in merchandise from a store. A municipal court judge sentenced her to probation, a $400 fine and 50 hours of community service.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>CHARGED:</b> Country singer <b>Mindy McCready,</b> 29, was arrested early Friday and charged with drunken driving after being stopped for speeding at about 3 a.m. in a Nashville suburb, Cpl. Candace Mowry tells AP. Mowry said the officer smelled alcohol in the vehicle and McCready performed poorly on a field sobriety test. The singer refused to take a breath alcohol test. Besides driving under the influence, McCready was charged with driving on a suspended license and failure to take the breath test, according to Mowry. McCready was booked into the Nashville jail and freed on $3,500 bond about six hours later. McCready (“A Girl’s Gotta Do What a Girl’s Gotta Do”) is already on three years supervised probation after pleading guilty to fraudulently obtaining the painkiller OxyContin at a pharmacy in February 2004, using the name of a friend on the prescription.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>SELECTED:</b> Star Wars creator <b>George Lucas,</b> 60, will receive the rare Festival Trophy at the Cannes Film Festival, where his Revenge of the Sith, the sixth and final installment of his fantasy series, will premiere next Sunday.

The rapper, 25, got the offer during her appearance in Manhattan Criminal Court, where she faces misdemeanor charges of assault, attempted assault and harassment in an Aug. 29 dispute at the Bloomie Nails salon, AP reports. Her lawyer, Joseph Tacopina, said Brown wasn’t interested in any resolution that involved her admitting to a crime. He said the offer, a plea to a misdemeanor with no jail time, was “normally a good one, but she’s not guilty.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>WED: Bobby Shriver,</b> the nephew of President John F.
