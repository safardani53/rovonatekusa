In 2015, she became the lead guitarist for the American rock band Evanescence.&nbsp;She became interested in music at the age of six and has been performing professionally since 2000. Majura is also the proprietor of a music school in Brilon, Germany.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Jen-Majura-3.jpg alt="Jen Majura" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Majura was a member of the bands Black Thunder Ladies (vocalist and guitarist), Equilibrium (bass), Knorkator (guitarist), and Evanescence 2015 (singer and guitarist).&nbsp;She has achieved multiple significant career milestones, including appearances at many of Europe’s biggest metal festivals, including Wacken in Germany, Hellfest in France, and Graspop in Belgium.</p><p>She has also toured the globe, appeared on television and collaborated with Blind Guardian in the studio. In 2012, Jen started playing guitar for the German band Knorkator.&nbsp;In May 2014, she became the bassist for the Pagan metal band Equilibrium. Jen runs a successful music school in Germany and has also released solo albums.&nbsp;Evanescence lead singer Amy Lee stated her eagerness to have Majura join the band in 2019. Jen Majura, she claimed, was an excellent addition since she was a vocalist and supplied backing vocals during live shows.</p><p>“I am a huge lover of layered voices, and having them better represented at our event has been a huge step forward for me. She also has a lot of energy. She has a terrific attitude, a lively personality, is extremely engaging, and is a killer onstage, so she’s been a great addition to our family. And, of course, having another lady in the band for the first time is fantastic.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Jen-Majura-2.jpg alt="Jen Majura" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Majura has released two solo albums to date: Jen Majura in 2014 and InZENity in 2017.&nbsp;Evanescence’s first album after 10 years, The Bitter Truth, was released in 2021, and the Los Angeles Times praised it as having “fiercest tracks to date.” Better Without You was the band’s first Top 10 Rock Radio song in ten years, and their previous single, Use My Voice, was nominated for ‘Best Rock’ at the MTV Video Music Awards.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGihnqZdoq6rwdGaZJ2doJa%2Ftb%2BMn6mopV2aw6K6xKyanqaTmnqistOeqWaalZ67qHnAZqeaqqRivKd506GcZpqRo7Fuss6rZHFlqZqus7%2BO</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kayla-moore.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kayla Moore- Wiki, Age, Height, Net Worth, Husband, Ethnicity</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./almanzo-wilder.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Fame | Almanzo Wilder net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-offensive-t-shirts-that-have-been-removed-from-stores.html>15 Most Offensive T-Shirts Ever</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./extreme-makeover-jillian-harris-edition.html>Extreme Makeover: Jillian Harris Edition!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lizzy-mcalpine-tour-2022-how-buy-tickets.html>Lizzy McAlpine tour 2022: How can I buy tickets?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nichole-lynel.html>Nichole Lynel</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./teddy-afro.html>Teddy Afro</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 LoopBlog.
