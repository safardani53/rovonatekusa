Granger was first noticed in a small work. Hollywood was selected by director Goldwyn, and was said to feature prominently in The North Star, a controversial film that praised the Soviet Union at the height of World War II, but later died of celestial its political position. Another war movie, The Purple Heart, follows, before Granger served the navy in Honolulu, in a military entertainment organization unit in the Pacific. Here he made some useful contacts including Bob Hope, Betty Grable and Rita Hayworth. It was also there that he began to explore his bisexuality, which he said he never felt the need to hide.
