That was just her fourth run and came after eight months off so you would expect some improvement. She likes this trip and a 5lb rise in the weights looks pretty fair.</p><p><strong>NASHWA (3.35 Goodwood, nb)</strong></p><p>She won this race 12 months ago and put in her best effort since when winning the Group 1 Falmouth Stakes by five lengths last time. That answered plenty of questions after her defeat at Newcastle and she can run up to that level again. She goes on any ground and we know there are no issues handling this tricky track.</p><p><strong>PERFUSE (1.50 Goodwood, treble)</strong></p><p>He ran much better than fifth place suggests in the King George Handicap at Royal Ascot last time. He was up front chasing the crazy early pace and looked the winner until paying the price inside the final furlong. He looks well ahead of the handicapper and this shorter trip won’t be an issue with Ryan Moore taking over a plus.</p><br><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">OFFERS OF THE DAY</h3></p><p><strong>Tote: Bet £10 Get £30 in Free Bets</strong> - <strong><a aria-label="CLAIM HERE (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">CLAIM HERE</a></strong></p><p><strong>Bet UK: Bet £10 Get £30 in Free Bets and Bonuses</strong> - <strong><a aria-label="CLAIM HERE (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" href=#>CLAIM HERE</a></strong></p><p><strong>William Hill: Bet £10 Get £40 in Free Bets (MOBILE ONLY)* </strong>- <strong></strong><a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener"><strong>CLAIM HERE</strong></a></p><p><strong>Betfair</strong>:<strong> Bet £10 Get £30 in Free Bets</strong> - <strong><a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener">CLAIM HERE</a></strong></p><p><strong>Paddy Power: Bet £20 and get it back as Cash if it Loses</strong> - <strong><a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener">CLAIM HERE</a></strong></p><p><strong>Sky Bet: <strong>Bet £10 Get £30 in Free Horse Racing Bets</strong> </strong>- <strong><a href=#>CLAIM HERE</a></strong></p><p>Tote: New customers online only. £/€10 min stake (if EW then min £/€10 Win + £/€10 Place).

He looks a big price to make the frame.</p><p>Theoryofeverything has a tricky high draw but should improve on this first crack at a handicap with William Buick on board.</p><p>2.25</p><p>VANDEEK looked destined for good things when winning on debut at Nottingham last time.</p><p>He was sleeping in the stalls and gave his rivals a big start before coming through the field to win going away.</p><p>Hopefully he’ll learn from that experience and Andrea Atzeni will get him out of the gates quicker.</p><p>He has plenty of talent and is proven with some give in the ground.</p><p>Unquestionable looks a threat after being collared in the dying strides at The Curragh last time.</p><p>He was in front a bit too soon in that classy contest and will go close again.</p><p>Jasour landed the July Stakes at Newmarket last time with plenty left in the tank.</p><p>That was over this trip and he’ll be a threat if enjoying what’s likely to be softer ground.</p><p>Sketch looked one to follow when winning by five lenths on debut at Newbury.</p><p>He ran strongly through the line and looks capable of figuring against these better rivals.</p><p>Lots of these youngsters are capable of better including Asadna who won by 12 lengths on debut at Ripon.</p><p>He was fancied for the Coventry Stakes at Royal Ascot but could only finish a modest ninth.</p><p>He bettered that with a Newbury Listed third and has solid place claims.</p><p>Toca Madera was a good third in the July Stakes when tackling this trip for the first time.</p><p>He’s likely to step forward from that encouraging effort.</p><p>Bobsleigh was outpaced dropped back to 5f for the Super Sprint at Newbury after a good effort in the Coventry. This distance will be more to his liking.</p><p>Frankie Dettori takes over on Nazalan who was a fair third in Listed company at Sandown last month.</p><p>He needs to show a lot more to figure at this level.</p><p>Watch My Tracer has won two of his three runs and wasn’t disgraced at Royal Ascot in between.</p><p>3.00</p><p>ESPIONAGE ended last season with an excellent second in a French Group 1 over a mile and this son of Galileo showed a liking for this distance when winning a Roscommon Listed contest on comeback last month.</p><p>You would expect him to take another step forward from that and he’s well up to this Group 3 level for Aidan O’Brien.</p><p>Artistic Star was a fair seventh in the Derby before another decent effort when third in the King Edward VII at Royal Ascot.</p><p>He takes a drop in class here over a distance that suits and has more to offer.</p><p>Chesspiece was third over 1m6f in the Queen’s Vase at the Royal meeting before dropping back to this distance for a gutsy Listed win at Hamilton.</p><p>He gives the impression that staying will be his game but he should run well again.</p><p>Desert Hero gave the King and Queen a Royal Ascot winner after a gutsy win in a hot handicap.</p><p>He stays well and is capable of better with few miles on the clock. This is tougher opposition so he will need more.</p><p>Canberra Legend was fifth at this level last time so needs to raise his game.</p><p>Burdett Road won the Golden Gates Handicap over 1m2f and wasn’t stopping so should stay. He needs a step forward in this higher grade.</p><p>3.35</p><p>NASHWA won this race 12 months ago and put in her best effort since when winning the Group 1 Falmouth Stakes by five lengths last time.</p><p>That answered plenty of questions after her defeat at Newcastle and she can run up to that level again.</p><p>She goes on any ground and we know there are no issues handling this tricky track.</p><p>Blue Rose Cen is the potential spanner in the works coming over from France.</p><p>She has been in fantastic form with seven wins from her nine starts.</p><p>Three of those came at Group 1 level including over this trip at Chantilly last time.</p><p>She is another who won’t mind the ground and will go very close if handling the track.</p><p>Above The Curve was a solid third in the Pretty Polly at The Curragh last month.</p><p>She is a Group 1 winner but needs to raise her game a little to beat the big two.</p><p>Al Husn beat Nashwa on the all-weather at Newcastle last time so isn’t dismissed lightly.</p><p>She probably caught her rival on a bad day so will need to improve to confirm that form.</p><p>Caernarfon was a good third in the Oaks so should handle the track and is better than we saw at Royal Ascot.</p><p>4.10</p><p>GRAY’S INN is only 3lb higher than her win at Chester two starts ago before she was pitched into a Sandown Listed contest.</p><p>She was an excellent fourth there and should find this easier.</p><p>Jack Channon’s hope has won on fast and soft ground and likes this trip.</p><p>Lincoln Legacy scored on debut at Kempton before a decent third at Windsor.</p><p>She shapes as though this extra furlong will bring improvement.</p><p>Conde was collared late when third at Chester.</p><p>Handling the Roodee’s turns and camber bodes well for showing his best form here.</p><p>Macundo made it three seconds in a row at Chelmsford. Moving up in distance may help but he could be better drawn.</p><p>Count Palatine shaped nicely when third at Newbury last time. He hasn’t been clobbered for this handicap debut.</p><p>Mission To Moon was a good second at Epsom and is another having his first run at this level. His opening mark of 81 gives him a chance.</p><p>4.45</p><p>ROARIN’ SUCCESS lived up to her name when scoring with plenty in hand at Ascot last month.</p><p>That was just her fourth run and came after eight months off so you would expect some improvement.</p><p>She likes this trip and a 5lb rise in the weights looks pretty fair.</p><p>Isle Of Jura is in flying form after wins at Newbury and Newmarket. They were both over this mile trip and a 6lb penalty gives him every chance.</p><p>Metal Merchant has the benefit of Ryan Moore on board after he tried to come from a mile back when third at Ascot. He could be ahead of the handicapper.</p><p>Glenfinnan was beaten just two lengths in a decent race at Newmarket on his handicap debut.</p><p>He likes this trip and, while he could have a better draw, the Andrew Balding hope should be in the mix.</p><p>Sea Eagle did well as a two-year-old, signing off with a Chelmsford success.</p><p>It’s a worry that we haven’t seen him since but his opening handicap mark looks fair.</p><p>Novus ran a cracker over 7f when second at Sandown. He was bit unlucky and wasn’t stopping at the line so should be capable of repeating that over this trip.</p><p>5.20</p><p>ORNELLAIA looks the pick of those to have seen a racecourse.</p><p>She cost more than a quarter of a million quid and repaid a sliver of that when third on debut at Newmarket.</p><p>The winner has come out and won a Group 3 so the form looks solid.</p><p>That was over 6f but she’s bred for further so should enjoy this slightly stiffer test.</p><p>Get Jiggy With It also made her debut at Newmarket, going down in a tight finish over this distance.</p><p>She was battling from a long way out and should have learned plenty from the experience.</p><p>Shadan Joy has been second on both starts and will have to raise her game.</p><p>Looking at the newcomers, Classical Song was an expensive buy and trainer Ralph Beckett is one of the best at getting horses ready to win on debut.</p><p>The booking of Ryan Moore takes the eye and her middle-distance pedigree suggests this trip will suit as a juvenile.</p><p>Gaasyah comes from Richard Hannon who does well with youngsters here.</p><p>She is related to two-year-old winners over this trip and a market move would be telling.</p><p>Oisin Murphy and Andrew Balding team up with Imperial Express who is from a sprinting family and should know her job.</p><p>5.55</p><p>ROCKET RODNEY was second in the Group 3 Molecomb Stakes here last season having landed his first victory at the track.</p><p>He has been a little hit and miss this season but his run at Doncaster two starts ago was very promising.</p><p>He wasn’t given much of a ride at Pontefract last time and returning to his favourite track can reignite his spark.</p><p>Desperate Hero is consistent and went down in a photo finish at Yarmouth last time.</p><p>He’s back from the same mark and is another who has run well here before.</p><p>Holkham Bay is having just his thrid run and went close on his turf debut at Doncaster last time.</p><p>He should build on that and looks on a fair weight.</p><p>JM Jungle is having a good season and followed a Hamilton second with a game win at Haydock.</p><p>This trip is ideal and he could improve past a 5lb rise in the weights.</p><p>Estate got the job done well at Windsor last time and was third on his last visit here.</p><p>Desert Games is interesting on this debut for new connections.</p><p>He was just pipped at Beverley last time and the first-time blinkers could also help.</p><p>Thunder Moor has been tried at Listed level and went close in a Yarmouth handicap seven days ago.</p><p>William Buick takes over and he has every chance from the same mark.</p><p>Templegate's tips</p><p>GOODWOOD</p><p>1.50 Perfuse (treble)</p><p>Good run at Royal Ascot and has more to come.</p><p>2.25 Vandeek</p><p>Made a good start at Nottingham and capable of better.</p><p>3.00 Espionage</p><p>Improving with every run and relishes this distance.</p><p>3.35 Nashwa (nb)</p><p>Won this race last year and no problem with longer trip.</p><p>4.10 Gray’s Inn</p><p>Held her own in Listed company at Sandown last time out.</p><p>4.45 Roarin’ Success (nap)</p><p>Caught the eye when scoring at Ascot

Rosie</p><p>Good second at Lingfield and more to come.</p><p>2.40 Impeller</p><p>Went close at Doncaster and right in the hunt again.</p><p>3.15 Three Yorkshireman</p><p>Has been running in stronger

be far away.</p><p>3.43 Justshortofabubble</p><p>Only 2lb higher than a good effort at Newton Abbot.</p><p>4.18 Aliomaana</p><p>Won nicely over course and distance last time out.</p><p>4.50 Annie Nail</p><p>Been knocking on the door and right there again.</p><p>5.25 Shantou Express</p><p>Has shown best form over this course and distance.</p><p>NEWCASTLE</p><p>4.56 Hot Team</p><p>Won this last year and right in hunt again.</p><p>5.32 Turner Girl</p><p>Been going close and this looks a good chance.</p><p>6.05 Saisons D’Or</p><p>Has won three times over this course and distance.</p><p>6.40
