With no other nation is this required.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE ON THE WORLD CUP">READ MORE ON THE WORLD CUP</h2><p>There was a very slim chance Ronaldo would be greeting the media, and everyone wanted a glimpse of the superstar on the verge of being <a href=#>sacked by Manchester United</a>.</p><p>Instead, it was Manchester City’s <a href=#>Bernardo Silva</a>, whose mood gradually worsened having to straight bat and defend question after question on Ronaldo, his future, and the impact on the mood and focus of the squad.</p><p>On the brink of losing his rag, Silva at one point said: “You only talk about it in press conferences when Portugal has a World Cup to play.</p><p>“I don't understand your persistence on this subject, because there is nothing.”</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Football</h2></p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong><a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">PLAY OUR DREAM TEAM WORLD CUP FANTASY FOOTBALL GAME TO WIN A SHARE OF £50k</a></strong></p><p>Of course, Silva is lying through his back teeth. Their whole tournament is now about Ronaldo, not whether <a href=#>Portugal</a> can add to their 2016 Euros triumph six years on.</p><p>Every single player that now goes into a Portugal press conference will know what barrage will be tossed their way, and that in itself is bound to take a lot out of them mentally.</p><p>Even <a href=#>their training</a> look to have been impacted. Other nations’ open sessions are usually jovial affairs. Loud music, lots of laughter and banter, before going into some serious drills.</p><p>Not Portugal. Around 200 members of media crowded onto an old-school stand by the pitch, waiting patiently before a chorus of camera clicks filled the air.</p><p>No smiles, no jokes, no hugs, no friendly embracing. Ronaldo trotted out and barely spoke to anyone for more than a few seconds, deciding to stretch on his lonesome.</p><p>He eventually joined in with some passing drills, although it was notable that United teammate Bruno Fernandes – with whom he is rumoured to <a href=#>have had a falling out with</a> – was as far away as possible on the other side of the pitch.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/WC-PORTUGAL_stats-NOV21Bv2-1.jpg><p>Silva added: “I don’t see any weird environment between Cristiano and Bruno. It’s something that belongs to Cristiano.</p><p>“It’s a personal matter and I don’t see a big deal out of it. It has nothing to do with the national team, it's his issue.</p><p>“I'm not a <a href=#>Manchester United</a> player, even if I were I wouldn't answer.</p><p>“We're in the national team, focused on our games. Not on Cristiano and not on his club.</p><p>“It is an issue that has to be resolved with the right person. I see him motivated and focused on the national team like all of us. It's one more thing to help our country.”</p><p>Ronaldo has certainly not helped his country’s chances of lifting the <a href=#>World Cup</a>. If anything, he has put them at risk of bombing in a group they should comfortably be topping.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>There is a small possibility that all of this unwanted attention, unnecessary drama, added spice, will spur Ronaldo on even further to drive his beloved Portugal to glory. Unlikely, but it is possible.</p><p>For now, the tension within the camp feels like it is close to tipping point. As ever, Ronaldo could be the solution on the pitch, but he also remains the problem off it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZH9xgJdqa3FwX5i%2Fqr%2FTopinp12nvK%2Bty52mZqifp8G2s8ClZLCnoqGxbq%2FUqWY%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./adam-haseley.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Fame | Adam Haseley net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./nelson-thomas-car-accident-saw-him-pulled-out-of-a-burning-vehicle.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Nelson Thomas car accident saw him pulled out of a burning vehicle Wed 15 March 2023 12:39</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-offensive-t-shirts-that-have-been-removed-from-stores.html>15 Most Offensive T-Shirts Ever</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./extreme-makeover-jillian-harris-edition.html>Extreme Makeover: Jillian Harris Edition!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lizzy-mcalpine-tour-2022-how-buy-tickets.html>Lizzy McAlpine tour 2022: How can I buy tickets?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nichole-lynel.html>Nichole Lynel</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./teddy-afro.html>Teddy Afro</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 LoopBlog.
