For those wondering, the Dec. 19 matchup between the <a href=#>Los Angeles Rams</a> and <a href=#>Green Bay Packers</a> looks much more impressive on paper — both teams were predicted as Super Bowl contenders, but now it seems they will both miss the playoffs ... yikes!</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>On that note, let's turn our attention to the WAGs, aka the wives and girlfriends of these <a href=#>NFL athletes</a>. We could focus on any of them, but today, we're setting our sights on Packers rookie wide receiver Christian Watson and his significant other. So, <a href=#>who is he dating</a>?

The 23-year-old wide receiver was dating Lakyn Adkins, but he put a ring on it less than a month before the 2022 NFL Draft. He announced their engagement and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">shared photos</a> of the proposal on Instagram, captioning the post "4.4.22. - [infinity]." Ugh — that is just so precious!</p><p>The two are college sweethearts — how do we know that? Well, the future Mrs. Watson <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">posted a humorous TikTok</a> in March 2022, stating that her younger self always imagined that she would be single during her freshman year of college. The 11-second video then switches to several clips of Christian, indicating that her plans changed once she met him. OK, we're crying.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>She supported him throughout his career as a Bison at North Dakota State, and obviously, nothing has changed since she's always attending Christian's games and cheering him on from the stands (presumably with the other Green Bay Packers WAGs).</p><p>Now, as for her career, several sources claim Lakyn is a cosmetologist; however, she's since taken a break from the profession after moving to Green Bay with Christian. As of now, it seems Lakyn is enjoying her time with Christian and their dog, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mylo</a>.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Christian Watson has been having a stellar rookie season.</h2><p>Since being drafted by the Packers in the 2022 NFL Draft, Christian has had quite an impressive rookie season.</p><p>Although it started rocky, his breakout performance came during the Week 10 matchup against the Dallas Cowboys; he caught four passes for 107 yards and three touchdowns in the Packers 31-28 overtime win. Since then, Christian has delivered several solid performances, which resulted in him being awarded Rookie of the Month in November 2022.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Christian's strong performances have not gone unnoticed by his teammates, especially legendary quarterback <a href=#>Aaron Rodgers</a>. Following the overtime victory over the Cowboys, the 39-year-old QB spoke with reporters and said he was proud of the rookie.</p><p>"We had a lot of plays designed for him, so I don’t think there was any other option," the four-time NFL MVP <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a>. "I think that (first touchdown) probably on the atomic level shifted a lot of different things for him, exorcising some energetic demons. I’m proud of him. He made some plays."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmLWztdKtoJqmXayutb%2FOp2SdmaSeu6g%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./emma-gonzalez.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Emma Gonzalez- Wiki, Age, Height, Net Worth, Boyfriend, Ethnicity</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./teen-mom-the-definitive-tragically-trashy-tattoo-guide-updated-3.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Tragically Trashy Tattoo Guide!</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-offensive-t-shirts-that-have-been-removed-from-stores.html>15 Most Offensive T-Shirts Ever</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./extreme-makeover-jillian-harris-edition.html>Extreme Makeover: Jillian Harris Edition!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lizzy-mcalpine-tour-2022-how-buy-tickets.html>Lizzy McAlpine tour 2022: How can I buy tickets?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nichole-lynel.html>Nichole Lynel</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./teddy-afro.html>Teddy Afro</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 LoopBlog.
