The 20-year-old singer, who first blew up with her 2018 ep Make My Bed, just released her debut album. Cheap Queen, to predominantly positive reviews. King Princess (born <strong>Mikaela Straus</strong>) has been dubbed “a burgeoning queer idol” by <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Pitchfork</a>&nbsp;and is poised to be a massive star in the coming decade. Before her SNL performance, here’s what you need to know.</p><p id=content-paragraph-2><strong>1. She’s signed to Mark Ronson’s record label. </strong>Her debut single, 2018’s “1950” was her <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>first release</a> on Mark’s <strong>Zelig Recordings</strong> label.&nbsp;Zelig is a joint venture with Columbia—where <strong>Harry Styles</strong> is signed. Keep that in mind, because the former One Direction star had a major influence on the start of her career.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3><strong>2. She’s built herself a dedicated following from the LGBTQ community. </strong>Her breakthrough, anthem “1950,” is a queer love anthem for the ages. The song garnered loads of support from the LGBTQ community, who loved the song’s honest lyrics. “I hate it when dudes try to chase me, but I love it when you try to save me, ’cause I’m just a lady, I love it when we play 1950,” she croons.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>“I’ve always been kind of a genderqueer person,” she told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>them</a> in 2018. “It’s something I kind of came into later ‘cause I didn’t really think about it as an identity as much as the way it had to do with the people I loved and the way I dressed…I like that I can ride that line on the periphery of femininity. I don’t always have to be an active participant. I think that’s really freeing.”</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-5><strong>3. Harry Style boosted her career — but she reportedly turned down a chance to open for him. </strong>“I love it when we play 1950,” <strong>Harry Styles</strong> tweeted in March 2018, reciting a lyric from King Princess’s debut single. Harry’s followers quickly flocked to King Princess after his ringing endorsement. <span>“I swear, there was nothing planned about that,” she told </span>them<span>. “It was wild. I woke up, and I was like, oh shit. This some sh-t.”&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-6>He would have been more instrumental in elevating KP’s early career, had she not expressed some wisdom beyond her years. In 2018, a <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>clip</a> surfaced of King Princess claiming that Harry asked her to open for him at Madison Square Garden in New York City. While incredibly flattered, King Princess claimes she politely declined because “that’s a massive f*cking venue. I’m not ready.” Somehow, she knew that it was a case of “too much, too soon,” and she opted out. But, she&nbsp;did thank him for offering her the slot, and “for loving the gays.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>It all worked in the end. King Princess will open up for Harry during his 2020 tour.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8><strong>3. Harry wasn’t the first person she turned down. </strong><span>The musician declined her first record deal to focus on school when she was 11-years-old. “I took some meetings when I was 11,” she told </span><a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>NME</a><span>. “I think what was interesting about being a young kid in environments like that was people were like, ‘You’re so sure of yourself! You’re so confident!’ And I was like, ‘I’m 12.’ Now I’ve got to this place where I’m like, ‘This is who I am.’ I’m so grateful for those experiences where I got to sit there and be like, ‘What the fuck is this shit?’ Cos I stopped feeling like that after a while. I stopped feeling lost in meetings, or I stopped feeling like people were telling me where to go and listening to invalid opinions.”</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-9><strong>4. She grew up surrounded by music. </strong>King Princess’ dad,&nbsp;<strong>Oliver Straus</strong>, is a recording engineer, and the owner of Brooklyn’s Mission Sound. Oliver, according to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Discogs</a>, has worked on albums by <strong>Cat Power, Monster Magnet, The Residents, Taking Back Sunday, P!nk, The National, </strong>and more.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10><strong>5. She’s bringing silly back. </strong>&nbsp;When NME asked why King Princess says “gak” a lot, she went on to explain it like this: The gakkety gakkety gak! It’s what the people say at the clubs – the gakkety gak. The zhuzh… &nbsp;It’s silly. The gays – we are silly. Being silly is really underrated right now because everything’s so fucking serious. And it’s true – it is serious. All the shit I watched growing up – SNL, 30 Rock, Parks And Rec, RuPaul – they’re all silly, and I feel that what made them so powerful is that they attained this level of seriousness and activism without being too cringy serious.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmaho2K4qrrGZqeroZ6YsrS%2FjKygp5%2BVp3qprdGrsGarpK65pr%2BMraauql1ogHl%2BmGxuaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./christmas-racing-fixtures-tv-guide.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Your Christmas racing guide - every big meeting, every big horse plus how and where to watch</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./ruben-olivares-19470114-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Rubn Olivares (Boxeador) - Edad, cumpleaos, biografa, hechos, familia, patrimonio neto, altura</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-offensive-t-shirts-that-have-been-removed-from-stores.html>15 Most Offensive T-Shirts Ever</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./extreme-makeover-jillian-harris-edition.html>Extreme Makeover: Jillian Harris Edition!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lizzy-mcalpine-tour-2022-how-buy-tickets.html>Lizzy McAlpine tour 2022: How can I buy tickets?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nichole-lynel.html>Nichole Lynel</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./teddy-afro.html>Teddy Afro</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 LoopBlog.
