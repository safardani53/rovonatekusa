At the end of it I said, ‘I’m going to marry you.’</p><p>"He laughed, and we kissed. He was going for an audition the next day and I texted him saying, ‘I hope you get this job today, because I will expect to be kept in the manner I’ve become accustomed to when we get married and have our two kids.’</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/NINTCHDBPICT000413284378.jpg><p>"He texted back saying, ‘What do you want from me!?’ I said, ‘Not much, just a top wedding and kid by next Christmas!’</p><p>"He answered saying, ‘Martha or Arthur?’ Our Martha was born by the next Christmas."</p><p>Julie's forthright approach worked and the lovable actress' life was transformed forever when she moved in with Ian a week later.</p><p>The Broadchurch star told Notebook magazine: "We went out on the Thursday night, I moved in with him on the following Wednesday and I was pregnant within six weeks.</p><p>"We went on a road trip across America and I did a pregnancy test on Santa Barbara pier, and there is a picture of us – we got a stranger to take it – pointing at the test saying, ‘We’ve just found out about you, Martha or Arthur!’ And it was Martha, who’s now 18.</p><p>"It’s just been like the greatest thing in my life."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/NINTCHDBPICT000003255752.jpg><p>And after 18 years together, Julie said that their penchant for big romantic gestures hasn't waned.</p><p>She continued: "Because I got pregnant so quickly, we said we’ve got to carry on courting each other and we have done. Very early on we got into the habit of really looking after each other and going on dates. We’re romantic, we have many romantic moments.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Happy Valley star</a>&nbsp;added: "But what was really romantic was that he wrote a one-woman play for me called The Greatest Play In The World and gave it to me as a Christmas present!

It wasn't a politically correct one, but this was back in 1998.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/NINTCHDBPICT000000694083.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/NINTCHDBPICT000005283643.jpg><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">most read in TV & Showbiz</h2></p><p>"The joke was that Roy Cropper (David Neilson) was going to go on a series of disastrous blind dates, one of them being with a man who had transgendered to a woman."</p><p>But Julie was determined to make soap’s first transgender character more than a joke and aimed to make the audience fall in love with her.</p><p>She added: "To me, that was it. You make people like this woman - understand her - and you say more than any political speech or lobbying."</p><p>Julie scooped six major awards during her time on Corrie, and her controversial assisted suicide scenes pulled in audience figures of over 9.5 million, despite thousands of fans boycotting the show as they were “too traumatised” to watch her die.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jq2tmqaUqLWww8GisWhpYGWEd4GSb2acp6KntqZ5ya6jop1dnbK0uc6nm6GZnJy1brTUrJmappRir6Ku2GafmrGcmsZur9Gop6mdomQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./dunkin-cookie-butter-cold-brew-returns-holiday-menu.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Dunkin' drops two new holiday flavors and fans say Starbucks is losing me</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./bachelor-in-paradise-wills-search-for-future-wife-takes-surprise-twist-with-mercedes.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Bachelor In Paradise Wills search for future wife takes surprise twist with Mercedes S</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-offensive-t-shirts-that-have-been-removed-from-stores.html>15 Most Offensive T-Shirts Ever</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./extreme-makeover-jillian-harris-edition.html>Extreme Makeover: Jillian Harris Edition!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lizzy-mcalpine-tour-2022-how-buy-tickets.html>Lizzy McAlpine tour 2022: How can I buy tickets?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nichole-lynel.html>Nichole Lynel</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./teddy-afro.html>Teddy Afro</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 LoopBlog.
