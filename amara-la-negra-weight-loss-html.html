Fans loved <a href=# rel=follow>Amara La Negra</a> embracing her Afro-Latina heritage whilst flaunting a loud and proud afro.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Fans were swooning over her left, right, and center. They adored her in what they considered her signature curvy look.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>However, the reality star dropped a few pounds over the last year. Turns out, her&nbsp;weight loss was not a welcome change to&nbsp;a distinguishable chunk of her fanbase. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Fans Unfollowed&nbsp;Amara La Negra Post Weight Loss</h2><p>In the previous year alone, Negra had lost over 35 pounds through routine exercises and new dietary regimens. Needless to say, she looks noticeably slimmer.&nbsp;</p><p>During an interview with Telemundo's <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Latinx Now!</a>, the stunning Latina shared that she was loving the weight loss but still embraced her stretch marks, cellulite,&nbsp;dimples—everything!</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>However, it was not the same with her fans. Some of whom apparently unfollowed her on social media post weight loss. And she had a good gauge on why that happened. She shared,&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>I had a fan base that followed me because I was very curvy and I represented the Latinas and the Black beautiful women that were curvy and I get that part, but some part of that was a little bit unhealthy for me, personally.</p><h2>Amara La Negra's Candid Opinion on Weight Loss</h2><p>Negra went on to reinstate that she had not forgone her curves and could very well get back to her curvaceous self. But this time around, she apparently wanted more control and was taking the gym route.&nbsp;</p><p>"To each its own," she said.&nbsp;</p><p>Still, Negra was candid to the former fans who had unfollowed her for her weight loss. She stressed that it was okay for people to unfollow her for not being "as thick."&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>"It’s ok my love because I’ll get a new fan base,” she quipped.&nbsp;</p><h2>Amara La Negra Expressed her Inability to Make Everyone Happy</h2><p>Negra, who has always been confident about her looks, called out people who had always been critical about her weight.&nbsp;</p><p>She shared how when she was still curvy, people would come up to her and tell her that she was "too fat" and that she needed to cut down on those pounds.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Now that she had undergone such a massive weight loss transformation, people would reach out saying that she was too skinny and that she needed to gain weight.&nbsp;</p><p>Having gone through both of these dichotomous fan opinions, Negra realized that she could never make everyone happy.</p><p>Instead, she argued that the most important thing for one to do was to make themselves happy.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Embracing her new look, the reality star has been regularly flaunting her new physique on her Instagram.</p><p>Evidently, she has also put her "unhealthy" past behind her as the oldest post that one can find on her socials are from March 2021.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>In another Instagram post (via <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Reality Titbit</a>), she shared that, initially, her weight loss was unintentional. Then, she apparently liked the results and started paying more serious attention to her gym and diet. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-618 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJmdlr%2BiecuaZKedl6eubsPEop6hrF2hvLS%2FjaGrpqQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./teen-horror-injuries-glassed-bar-18-birthday-huddersfield.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Teen's horror injuries after she was glassed in the face while at bar celebrating her 18th birthday</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./holly-baxter-19890703-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Holly Baxter (Fitness Instructor) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-offensive-t-shirts-that-have-been-removed-from-stores.html>15 Most Offensive T-Shirts Ever</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./extreme-makeover-jillian-harris-edition.html>Extreme Makeover: Jillian Harris Edition!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lizzy-mcalpine-tour-2022-how-buy-tickets.html>Lizzy McAlpine tour 2022: How can I buy tickets?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nichole-lynel.html>Nichole Lynel</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./teddy-afro.html>Teddy Afro</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 LoopBlog.
