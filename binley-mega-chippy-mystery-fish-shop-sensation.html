We have to order more stuff, because if it stays like this, we won’t be able to cope.</p><p>"We will have to see how the week pans out … We have to be prepared, we don’t want to run out of food.

But you never know, it could continue throughout the summer.”</p><p>The owner said on Monday he had one customer who jumped off a flight from Australia - and had hired a car and drove straight to Binley Mega Chippy.</p><p>Customers have swarmed from all parts of the UK too, including Essex, Portsmouth, and Dundee.</p><p>Josh Perks, 18, made an eight hour round trip from his home in Portsmouth with two pals after seeing the takeaway trending on TikTok.</p><p>He said: "We just thought it would be a laugh, we wanted to see what the fuss was about.</p><p>"It was great fun, there was a bit of a party atmosphere going on. I don't think the staff there can get their heads around what is really going on."</p><p>Student Ben Bradley, 19, from Coventry, added: "I met a bloke who had come over from France.</p><p>"Who comes from France to Coventry?

It certainly shows the power of social media. It's like a festival around here.</p><p>"It has to be the most famous destination in Coventry right now and it's just our local chip shop."</p><p>Foodie influencer Mashtag Brady, 28, from Derby, said: "It was like travelling to Mecca, it's like it has become a place of worship.</p><p>"I saw loads of other famous TikToker influencers there as well, it's the place to be at the minute, everybody just wants to be part of the moment.</p><p>"There was even a guy outside offering free hair cuts, its become the place to promote other businesses too. It's crazy.</p><h2>LOCAL CHIPPY SUCCESS</h2><p>"But in reality the place is just a bang average chippy, but that's what's so funny about it.</p><p>"I had battered sausage, chips and curry sauce with a can of coke and it came to about £6.50, so it was reasonably priced.</p><p>"I was beginning to wonder if it was all a big prank as I hadn't actually seen any videos of people eating there.</p><p>"But when I got there, the queue was out of the door. It was rammed. They must be making a mint.</p><p>"Some of the lads said they had travelled three hours on three buses to get there. People are coming from all over."</p><p>Two teenage girls, who had travelled from Nottinghamshire to visit the chippy wearing Binley Mega Chippy Mega Fan T-shirts, told the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Guardian</a>: "We saw it on TikTok.</p><p>"It’s just quite random and that’s what makes it funny.</p><p>"We made the T-shirts to wear when we came, and they gave us a free bottle of lemonade and photos with them.</p><p>“I’m not normally a fish and chip person, but for Binley Mega Chippy I had to have some.”</p><h2>BINLEY MEGA CHIPPY</h2><p>Another three pals travelled from London to the shop - after seeing it online and finding the content hilarious.</p><p>Angus, Taylor, and Amir said: "We were on a call this morning, laughing about the Binley Mega Chippy and one of us was just, like, ‘Should we go?’</p><p>“I think it’s one of those things where it’s so random, it’s funny.</p><p>"They didn’t even make the song themselves, and they have got so much free publicity.”</p><p>Mum Rachel Charlton said: "It’s absolutely ludicrous. They are just all obsessed with TikTok.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on The Sun">Read more on The Sun</h2><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The Sun">Read More on The Sun</h2><p>"Yesterday we were in the middle of deepest, darkest Wales on a mountain for a mountain biking race and we could hear people talking about it.
