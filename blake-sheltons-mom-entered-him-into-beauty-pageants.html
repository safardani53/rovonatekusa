I don’t like singing. I changed my mind.’ It’s embarrassing! You get beat up when you go to school.”</p><p>Apparently his mother,&nbsp;<strong>Dorothy</strong>, who owned a beauty salon, was “a full on stage mom” when he was only 7, The Voice coach joked, begging the hosts to change the topic. Shelton starting writing songs at 15 and moved to Nashville at 17 — he dropped his first single, “Austin,” when he was 25.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/blake-shelton.jpg><p>The country star, 41, was on Live! to promote his new album,&nbsp;Texoma Shore, which includes many songs about his girlfriend,&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Gwen Stefani</strong></a>.

He recently confirmed that his <a href=#>latest single from the album, “Turnin’ Me On,” </a>was written for her. “I’m super proud of it — and it’s not hard to figure out who this song is about,” he said in a press release on Wednesday, November 1.</p><p>During an appearance on Late Night with Seth Meyers, Shelton explained the first time he played the song for his girlfriend of two years.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener data-track-category="Article Page" data-track-action="Tap Interstitial Link" data-track-label=https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/pictures/country-hunks-20141711/>Country Music’s Hottest Hunks</a></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“She was there when I was recording a lot of [Texoma Shore] in Oklahoma. So, she would hear this stuff as it was going down,” he told host <strong>Seth Meyers</strong> on the Wednesday night show. “I remember when I wrote this song and then recorded it, I was like, ‘Oh yeah, here’s another one,’ because I didn’t want to say [‘It’s about you’] … it’s embarrassing! I mean, come on. You don’t want to be like, ‘Hey I wrote a song about you.’ But I did write a song about her!”</p><p>While he didn’t tell her he had <a href=#>written the song directly</a> about her, it was easy to figure out — the line “She’s Revlon red” references her campaign with the makeup brand.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJmlmZuaerS0xKWrqKajYrqwuYyepa2dopqxbrTIpmSipqSkeqOxwK6rsmWglrSmrc2tqmg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./daniel-craig-then-now-photos.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Daniel Craig Then &amp;amp; Now Photos Of His Transformation Hollywood Life</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./antonio-conte.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Antonio Conte</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-offensive-t-shirts-that-have-been-removed-from-stores.html>15 Most Offensive T-Shirts Ever</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./extreme-makeover-jillian-harris-edition.html>Extreme Makeover: Jillian Harris Edition!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lizzy-mcalpine-tour-2022-how-buy-tickets.html>Lizzy McAlpine tour 2022: How can I buy tickets?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nichole-lynel.html>Nichole Lynel</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./teddy-afro.html>Teddy Afro</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 LoopBlog.
