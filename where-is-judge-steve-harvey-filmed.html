The fact that the funnyman has become a judge overnight won’t surprise any of his longtime fans as they know the multi-hyphenate has many talents, plus he brings his signature wit to the bench, which is sure to help ease the tension as he tries to figure out solutions to real-world conflicts.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Over the course of a few episodes, many fans have noticed that the courtroom Steve presides over looks very real. Is Judge Steve Harvey filmed in a real courthouse? Here’s everything you need to know about the filming location.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Where is 'Judge Steve Harvey' filmed?</h2><p>Everyone knows Steve Harvey is a great comedian, but now we get to see the his serious side as well. On Judge Steve Harvey, Steve digs up the real stories behind the conflicts that people are facing and uses his decades of life experience to mediate the situation and come up with a solution that everyone is happy with.</p><p>The unscripted comedy is set in a very realistic-looking courtroom, which has many people wondering if Steve’s court is filmed in an actual courtroom. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Cinemaholic</a>, Judge Steve Harvey is filmed in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Trilith Studios</a>, which is in Fayetteville, Ga.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Fayetteville is located just 22 miles south of Atlanta, at 461 Sandy Creek Road, making it about a 30-minute commute from the city. The filming location makes sense for Steve, who, as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Sun reports</a>, bought a mansion previously owned by Tyler Perry for $15 million in 2020, in the wealthy neighborhood of Buckhead, Atlanta.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Judge Steve Harvey joins a roster of other hit productions like Marvel’s Hawkeye and Spider-Man: No Way Home, which also filmed at Trilith Studios. The studio’s campus is massive and has been designed as a hub for the film industry, featuring “filmmaking studios, homes, shopping and dining, trails and parks.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Trilith aims to build a creative community over time and to that end, has teamed up with Georgia Film Academy and the University of Georgia. As part of the program, students from the Master of Fine Arts film program get the chance to work and live on-site during their second year, so aspiring filmmakers can work on real-life productions, such as Judge Steve Harvey.</p><p>The courtroom in Judge Steve Harvey was built at the studio specifically for the show, meaning that it’s certainly not a real-life house of law. However, the meticulous detail and expert lighting do make it appear quite real. The studio has made sure all of the elements of a real courtroom are present on the show’s set, including a witness panel, seating area for spectators, and of course, Steve Harvey's own judge’s bench.</p><p>Judge Steve Harvey airs every Tuesday at 8 p.m. on ABC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWmvsRmoKxlmqqxqLGMrKuerpVitaK%2B1Z6wZp6ZobqmsA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./gabbi-garcias-boyfriend-list.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Gabbi Garcia Dating Gabbi Garcia's Boyfriend &amp;amp; Exes</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./clash-of-the-covers-the-vampire-diaries-vs-true-blood.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Vampire Diaries vs. True Blood</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-offensive-t-shirts-that-have-been-removed-from-stores.html>15 Most Offensive T-Shirts Ever</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./extreme-makeover-jillian-harris-edition.html>Extreme Makeover: Jillian Harris Edition!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lizzy-mcalpine-tour-2022-how-buy-tickets.html>Lizzy McAlpine tour 2022: How can I buy tickets?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nichole-lynel.html>Nichole Lynel</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./teddy-afro.html>Teddy Afro</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 LoopBlog.
