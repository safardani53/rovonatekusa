His tales included how a soldier carried on running after his head had been blown clean off.</p><p>Another time he carried an injured soldier back to the trenches, where he was found to be dead. He had been shot while being carried, but Alfred was the target.</p><p>Sam’s grandad won the Military Medal for helping to rescue comrades from no man’s land.</p><p>Because he was small and a hard target for snipers, he also volunteered to carry messages.</p><p>When Sam was 12 Alfred gave him a hand-written “contract” in which the boy promised to write his first novel by the age of 18.</p><p>His grandad told him: “You’re going to tell stories. This is what you have to do.”</p><p>Sam says: “The image of that little man, cut adrift in that vast, misty landscape, stayed with me.”</p><p>Against all the odds, he survived this new ordeal and was transferred to a prisoner of war camp hospital in Cologne.</p><p>There, a sergeant who spoke a little English asked if Pte Peers wanted to stay in Germany after the war and to sign papers to make him a naturalised German.</p><p>The outraged Tommy said: “I refused and the sergeant told me I was a fool as I would have got my liberty if I had signed.”</p><p>But six months after the attack, and still paralysed, he was put on a prisoner-exchange train to Brussels and finally arrived at the Queen Alexandra Military Hospital in Millbank, central London, in May 1916.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/01/NINTCHDBPICT000552161958.jpg><p>Pte Peers was transferred to Ralston Hospital in Glasgow, where he was discharged, given a weekly disability pension of 40 shillings (£2) and a silver war badge which wounded servicemen wore to show they had done their bit at the Front.</p><p>Now out of the Army, David, permanently paralysed from the waist down and classed as “100 per cent disabled”, got married to Kathleen in 1917.</p><p>Ten years after the battle that nearly killed him, he landed a job making Remembrance wreaths at the poppy factory in Richmond, South West London.</p><p>He and wife had six children and the ex-Tommy died in 1935, aged just 40.
