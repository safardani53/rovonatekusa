They kept it quiet for as long as they could but they’re happy and can’t wait to make it official.</p><p>“They flew out to Italy this week to try and settle on the perfect location, but it’s going to be a low-key wedding — very romantic and just with closest family and friends.</p><p>“They have been looking at venues in Rome, Lake Como and Tuscany and will make their final choice over the next few days.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in TV</h2></p><p>“But whichever they choose, Kelly is the happiest she has ever been. Meeting Jeremy and now planning their wedding together has been like a dream come true for her.”</p><p>Kelly and fellow model Jeremy met in late 2014 after she saw a video of him online. She sought him out on Instagram, saying later: “I wasn’t very cool, I went straight in.”</p><p>Jeremy, who comes from a small village near Rome but grew up in Paris, moved in with Kelly not long after they started dating.</p><p>They went public with the relationship in April 2015 — and Kelly has long believed limelight-shunning Jeremy is “the one”.</p><p>Kelly, who co-hosts the Drive Time&nbsp;&nbsp; show with JK on Heart FM, said of their seventh anniversary in April this year: “He put together a really lovely photo album of all his favourite pictures and moments.</p><p>“He’s done it every year for the past seven years.</p><p>“He’s definitely the most romantic of the two of us. He’s Italian and French, so what can I say?”</p><p>As the couple fell deeper in love, Kelly revealed she had asked Jeremy to marry her while on holiday in 2020 — only to be turned down.</p><p>She explained: “When we were in Antigua and the sun was setting and we were up at Shirley Heights I said to Jeremy, ‘Will you marry me?’ He said, ‘Be quiet, there are people around’.</p><p>“So I tried to propose but he said it was too busy and told me to be quiet! I’ve asked him, but it wasn’t private enough.”</p><p>Kelly and Jeremy are getting married this summer in Italy. They kept it quiet for as long as they could but they’re happy and can’t wait to make it official.</p><span class=quote-credit>A source</span><p>Pals say Kelly’s relationship with Jeremy is like none of her others.</p><p>She was previously engaged to actors Jason Statham, 54, and Billy Zane, 56, and was also set to tie the knot with Gladiators star David McIntosh, 36.</p><p>Other celebrity exes include rugby players Danny Cipriani, 34, and Thom Evans, 37.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The source continued: “Kelly and Jeremy are the perfect fit. All of Jeremy’s goals are Kelly’s goals — it is something she has wanted for a long time.</p><p>“He isn’t into the limelight and prefers a quiet life at home with Kelly.”</p><p>She was first scouted as a model aged 16 and later posed for magazines including FHM and Loaded.</p><p>Kelly became a household name after she landed a presenting job on Channel 4’s The Big Breakfast in 1999 — replacing Denise van Outen.</p><p>She has also starred in US TV shows including Smallville in the early Noughties and One Big Happy in 2014.</p><p>Kelly’s reality TV credits also include a stint on Strictly Come Dancing, where she came fourth, and The Masked Dancer, making the semi-finals as Frog.</p><p>Last year Kelly, who also has a range of clothing with Tesco’s F&F, revealed she had come to terms with never marrying or starting a family.</p><p>She said: “It’s more difficult to have children after 40, I know that. But if it’s something you don’t really want to do, it’s OK. I didn’t really want to have children.</p><p>“I didn’t want to get married and that’s OK. It’s OK to say that now.”</p><p>However, those close to Kelly say she decided to play coy over her engagement with Jeremy so the pair could savour the moment just between them.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The Sun">Read More on The Sun</h2><p>A source added: “This wedding is something she has dreamt of her whole life but it will be equally as low-key as her engagement — which she has kept under wraps for a while now.</p><p>Kelly and Jeremy could not be happier.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/NINTCHDBPICT000738960553.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/NINTCHDBPICT000611901469.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/NINTCHDBPICT000738960547.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/NINTCHDBPICT000738960450.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2ispmSCdn6Pbm1yZ5uaua3FjJupqKebYrqivtGyZKOdopq6unnPmqmiq5litrWty7Jm</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./celebrities-wearing-double-denim-khloe-kardashian-jenner-pics.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kylie Jenner &amp;amp; More Hollywood Life</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./anthony-tiffith-19740420-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Anthony Tiffith (Business Executive) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-offensive-t-shirts-that-have-been-removed-from-stores.html>15 Most Offensive T-Shirts Ever</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./extreme-makeover-jillian-harris-edition.html>Extreme Makeover: Jillian Harris Edition!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lizzy-mcalpine-tour-2022-how-buy-tickets.html>Lizzy McAlpine tour 2022: How can I buy tickets?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nichole-lynel.html>Nichole Lynel</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./teddy-afro.html>Teddy Afro</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 LoopBlog.
