You found me all alone / I found myself a Blarney Stone.”</p><p class=p1>He concluded: “Irina, I will love you forever and ever and ever, I do.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Love-Is-Blinds-Zack-Goytowski-Confirms-He-Didnt-Actually-Write-His-Original-Proposal-Song-to-Irina-Solomonova-310.jpg><p class=p1>The Solo founder enthusiastically nodded while listening to Zack’s tune<a href=#> through the pod walls</a> before proclaiming that his proposal is “the easiest yes of my life” and that she “can’t wait to change the world” with her man.</p><p class=p1>Shortly after the debut&nbsp;<i>Love Is Blind&nbsp;</i>episodes were released, eagle-eyed viewers noticed that the Seattle resident’s ditty was reminiscent of the band Ludo’s “Sara’s Song.” Zack has since confirmed that he actually did not pen <a href=#>his so-called original track</a>.</p><p class=p1>“Listen to the song that inspired the cringiest moment in&nbsp;<i>LIB&nbsp;</i>history,” the criminal defense lawyer jokingly wrote via Instagram Story on Tuesday, March 28, sharing a link to Ludo’s OG version.</p><p class=p1>The St. Louis-based rock musicians later revealed that they were aware of <a href=#>the twist on their single</a>. “Yes, we know and the show got our permission. Glad to know you guys are looking out for us,” a post on the group’s<a href=#> Twitter</a> account read on Saturday, March 25.</p><p class=p1>Zack — who proposed to Irina after breaking up with fellow contestant <a href=#><strong>Bliss Poureetezadi</strong></a>&nbsp;— also sang the group’s “Lake Pontchartrain” and “Love Me Dead” in the pods, which did not make the show’s final edit.</p><p class=p1>“@ludoband&nbsp;I absolutely love you guys. I actually explain that this was not an original song and that I changed the lyrics to one of my favorite love songs,” Zack replied to the band’s <a href=#>Instagram</a> post about his lyric change. “That was cut along with the rest of the song but a small portion.”</p><p class=p1>He added: “I also sang ‘Love Me Dead’ in the pods, probably should have sang that at the proposal instead of ‘Sara’s Song.’ … Our southern cast member&nbsp;<a href=#>@paulpeden</a>&nbsp;appreciated [my rendition of] ‘Lake Ponchatrain.’”</p><p class=p1>While Irina said “yes” to Zack’s musical proposal, their relationship soon hit a snag when they entered the outside world face-to-face. After the Russia native <a href=#>struggled to physically connect with her new fiancé</a>, they decided to break off their engagement during <a href=#>the cast’s Mexico vacation</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>“[Meeting him] was a lot more challenging than I thought it was gonna be. Like, it was really hard to connect the connection&nbsp;we made in the pods&nbsp;versus being together,” Irina <a href=#>exclusively told&nbsp;<i>Us Weekly&nbsp;</i>earlier this month</a>. “I will say that when I saw him it wasn’t anything about his looks or anything, but I just had this gut feeling that something just didn’t feel right and I didn’t feel safe or comfortable. … It was just something that grew and I feel I&nbsp;was kinda trying to force or pressure myself&nbsp;to feel these feelings for him.”</p><p class=p1><i>The first five episodes of Love Is Blind are currently streaming on Netflix.
