The products we picked stood out from the sea of blackhead-busting promises because they efficiently removed pore debris, created little redness, and left our skin feeling smooth.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">"Exfoliation, blackhead and oil removal — these are all at the core of what pore strips do," board-certified dermatologist Morgan Rabach M.D. tells PEOPLE. "It's really a fast, quick fix for stubborn blackheads and clogged pores and can make skin instantly smoother [and] less congested," she says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Of all the pore strips that PEOPLE Tested, these were considered the best for unclogging pores.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-hero-cosmetics-mighty-patch-nose></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Overall</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Hero Cosmetics Mighty Patch Nose</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Hero Cosmetics Mighty Patch Nose" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/5IXP3olxK0MnlDFH4aLIFaG_yko=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/mighty-patch-nose-pore-pimple-patches-9dc4555ff63a4381a8c3d1f2845f0fc0.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ulta</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1.5><li readability=0><p>They work their magic overnight, as the intended wear time is six to eight hours<br></p></li><li readability=0><p>You can visibly see the gunk coming out of your skin, so you know these strips are doing their job</p></li><li readability=0><p>It's sensitive skin-friendly because of its fragrance-free materials and non-abrasive hydrocolloid gel</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Although marketed as a patch, the mighty nose patch from Hero Cosmetics works similarly to a pore strip — so similarly, we're going to call it a pore strip for the sake of this article. As our favorite and best overall pick, this strip does all the work for you, working overnight (six to eight hours!) to clear up your skin and remove dirt from your pores.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The application was somewhat intricate, but felt like a bandaid on our skin — noticeable, but not uncomfortable. Using hydrocolloid (a fluid-absorbing gel), this patch creates a barrier on the skin which traps oil and dirt around acne spots, and then lifts it from the skin when removed. The best part? The patch turns white as it pulls gunk out of your skin so you can see the results clearly.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While we thought the patches were a bit sticky (our nails kept getting caught and then the sticky part got stuck together), we appreciated that it didn't irritate any of our team members' complexions. As a dermatologist-approved product, this patch is unscented and ideal for sensitive skin. It's super thin and peels off without causing pain. Most of all, we loved how smooth our skin felt after using this patch. We believe this is the perfect pore strip for all skin types.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>How it's held up:</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We tested these strips for months and can confidently say that we're still loving them today as much as we did when we first tested them out. It's nice to be able to set 'em and forget 'em as we go about our nighttime routine, just to wake up and peel off the thin strips to reveal pore-perfected skin. And while we appreciate how thin they are, we do wish they weren't so flimsy, as they can easily get stuck together. However, we still think the hype is real with these Hero patches.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Wear time: </strong>6-8 hours | <strong>Skin type: </strong>Sensitive | <strong>Special ingredients: </strong>Hydrocolloid | <strong>Best uses: </strong>Blackhead removal, reducing oil and acne | <strong>Included strips: </strong>10</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>People / Jhett Thompson</span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-tonymoly-tako-pore-one-shot-nose-pack></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Budget</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>TonyMoly Tako Pore One Shot Nose Pack</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="TonyMoly Tako Pore One Shot Nose Pack" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/k85z0uKjIAXjvFerNCp4uxR84JM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/tonymoly-tako-pore-one-shot-nose-pack-bbc80e3b98d843f0a9d8cc6fbc242617.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0.5><li readability=0><p>This admirably-priced pore strip is hard on pore gunk, but not your skin</p></li><li readability=-1><p>It also effectively removed small hairs from our complexions</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Our skin looked and felt less oily after a single use</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Our tester appreciated this affordable option for its ability to remove "a good amount of sebaceous materials" as well as small hairs from her nose. The unique shape of this pore strip covers the nose and the section of the forehead between your brows, and has a tight adhesive that effectively opens clogged pores.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">During its application, the strip became very tight on our tester's skin, which she said "was a bit uncomfortable" but let her know "it was working!" The removal process caused a tinge of pain when the strip was ripped off, but our tester said her nose felt "super soft after using the strip and definitely look[ed] clearer." She saw some redness after removing the strip, but "no major irritation."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Overall our team loved how effectively this pore strip worked to remove oil and grime from pores. "I would use this strip again!" our tester exclaimed. "My nose and forehead both felt very smooth afterward. It's also fun to use because it makes a little octopus on your nose going up to your forehead." This unscented and playful pore strip is our favorite option for those on a budget.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>How it's held up:</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">To our great surprise, these low-cost strips are still working their magic, even months down the line. We've noticed that our makeup is laying more smoothly on our skin because the sheet has been effectively removing our blackheads, leaving us with clearer complexions both with makeup and without. Even though some of our team members have sensitive skin, they haven't experienced any irritation or inflammation throughout the months of long-term testing. Our one wish? That it was made with charcoal to further purify our skin — but for its drugstore price, we're happy with what we have.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Wear time: </strong>10-15 minutes | <strong>Skin type: </strong>Dry | <strong>Special ingredients: </strong>Dead sea salt, taurine, black peat water | <strong>Best uses: </strong>Shrink pores | <strong>Included strips: </strong>1</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>People / Jhett Thompson</span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-investment-peace-out-pores-oil-absorbing-nose-strips></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Investment</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Peace Out Pores Oil-Absorbing Nose Strips</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Peace Out Pores Oil-Absorbing Nose Strips" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/DAxZFt6YA91Enjo8E1tXk_Qojzs=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/peace-out-pores-oil-absorbing-nose-strips-67c7af4ea36c4b71bcfab011418415cb.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=2><li readability=3><p>You get a pack of 8 strips, which are half nose strips, and half skincare-packed pore strips, for a reasonable price</p></li><li readability=-1><p>They're effective at lifting blackheads and absorbing oil</p></li><li readability=-1><p>We noticed visibly less oily skin after wearing these strips</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Peace Out Skincare is known for its ability to work magic on acne and pores, and these pore strips don't disappoint. This particular set comes with four nose strips and four standard pore strips (for your forehead and chin) that work overnight to reduce oil and blackheads on your skin.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Our tester appreciated its effectiveness, and said, "some of the blackheads came off my face along with some oil." She said it felt comfy on the skin, and didn't cause any irritation or redness. It had an "easy removal with no pain," she added. While our tester didn't wear the strip overnight, she was impressed with how well it worked in just a short period during testing. "I can imagine how powerful it can be [when used] overnight!"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The only thing she would change is how heavy it felt on her face, noting that its weight "feels like a bandage on my chin." The weight is likely due to the strip being packed full of ingredients like hydrocolloid, retinol, and DMAE (which helps improve skin tone), and considering the strip is worn while you sleep, its weight likely won't bother most people. We love this brand and these pore strips and if you don't mind paying a little extra, you'll see why these pore strips are worth the price.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>How it's help up:</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While we still think these pore strips stand out from the crowd, our team member who tested these out for a few months was not over the moon with the progress she'd hoped her skin would make while using these patches. While these certainly seemed to clean out her pores, there wasn't so much improvement in the size of them (she was hoping they'd shrink with continual use). She also felt that removing the strips in the morning was a bit more painful than the experience other testers had in the lab, which makes us think you don't need to leave them on for the full four to six hours recommended.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Wear time: </strong>4-6 hours | <strong>Skin type: </strong>Oily, combination, normal | <strong>Special ingredients: </strong>Hydrocolloid, retinol, DMAE | <strong>Best uses: </strong>Cleaning pores, removing oil | <strong>Included strips: </strong>8</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>People / Jhett Thompson</span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-acne-patchology-breakout-box-3-in-1-acne-treatment-kit></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for Acne</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Patchology Breakout Box 3-in-1 Acne Treatment Kit</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt=Patchology-breakout-box-3-in-1-acne-treatment-kit style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/b69eR2AWDNaVmOkxZVjOwgoccLA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/patchology-breakout-box-3-in-1-acne-treatment-kit-9ff3769ef21a4c548600617d8a36547d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Dermstore</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1><li readability=0><p>Complete with pore strips and pimple patches, this kit is the ultimate skincare set</p></li><li readability=0><p>In addition to de-gunking our pores, these strips (and dots) helped calm our skin</p></li><li readability=-1><p>We saw reduced redness in our skin after wearing these strips</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This 3-in-1 acne treatment kit works wonders on your skin, reducing the size and redness of pimples and lifting grime from your skin before new acne can grow. Our tester had a breakout forming at the time of testing, and noticed that the whitehead absorbing dot had completely absorbed the sebum surrounding the bump after three and half hours. "I'm confident it would have absorbed the sebum in the whitehead's center if I'd continued using the dot," he said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The nose strip was equally effective, and removed many sebaceous filaments after only 10 minutes. Our tester felt the strip tighten on his skin during use and appreciated how much grime was on the strip after use. The salicylic acid dots were slightly less effective, but only because the tester used them on his mouth area, which sees more movement than other parts of the face. He felt it loosen after an hour or so, and believed it not to be sticky enough.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Our tester liked the feel of all three products, saying the nose strip has "zero feeling on your skin even though you know it is applied," and the acne dots blend into your skin and have zero irritation during and after use. While this kit is also in the pricier range, we believe the cost matches the value, and that those with oily and acne prone skin will benefit from this 3-in-1 system intended to stop acne before, during, and after it forms.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>How it's held up:</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Even after six months of testing, we're still seeing the blackhead and blemish-busting efforts of these patches and strips paying off. We love that you can get a pack of all three — charcoal strips, hydrocolloid, and salicylic acid patches — in one purchase, which gives this $20 pack a whole lot more value than some of its competitors. Another huge plus? These strips do the opposite of abrasion (which you'd expect from most hard-to-remove strips), and they actually soothe our skin, leaving it feeling smoother than before.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Wear time: </strong>10-15 minutes for strips, 6-8 hours for dots | <strong>Skin type: </strong>Oily, acne-prone | <strong>Special ingredients: </strong>Salicylic acid, tea tree oil, hydrocolloid | <strong>Best uses: </strong>Acne, blackheads | <strong>Included strips: </strong>3 | <strong>Included dots: </strong>48</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Jhett Thompson</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-t-zone-formula-1006-down-to-the-pore-strips-pack></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for T-Zone</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Formula 10.0.6 Down To the Pore Strips Pack</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt=Formula-1006-down-to-the-pore-strips-pack style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/dV8_-EQDNg750enlMs4Ge4IHceA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/formula-1006-down-to-the-pore-strips-pack-0d9eb2311cb1426b941978e5c4f258c6.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0.5><li readability=-1><p>These strips were perfect for absorbing oil from and cleaning the pores in our T-Zones</p></li><li readability=0><p>Its charcoal base worked to purify our skin, cleansing as it extracted our sebum and blackheads</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Our skin was noticeably smoother after just one use</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This T-Zone-friendly strip effectively and comfortably pulled sebaceous materials from our tester's skin without issue.

We like that this strip targets all parts of the face that see excessive oil — the forehead, nose, and chin — and the low price doesn't hurt either.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>How it's held up:</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">One of the biggest perks of these strips even after months of use? The way we can see all of the gunk that comes out of our pores against the black material. We've noticed that our skin does seem to be clearer after continued use of these strips (usually worn weekly), but we didn't notice any shrinking of our pores (which would have been lovely). Our only note is that they tend to leave a black residue behind due to the charcoal, so just be sure to cleanse your skin one more time after you remove these quick and easy strips.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Wear time: </strong>10-15 minutes | <strong>Skin type: </strong>Oily, combination, normal | <strong>Special ingredients: </strong>Charcoal, witch hazel, moroccan lava clay | <strong>Best uses: </strong>Drawing out impurities, cleansing clogged pores | <strong>Included strips: </strong>8</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>People / Jhett Thompson</span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-charcoal-ulta-charcoal-nose-strips></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Charcoal</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Ulta Charcoal Nose Strips</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Ulta Charcoal Nose Strips" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/nZCrLUL-x5VWP1a5ilfTDa6JPto=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ulta-charcoal-nose-strips-26f3fb820f174f909be81e5f6c63001f.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ulta</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1.5><li readability=0><p>These charcoal strips adhered well to our skin without causing any irritation or pain when we removed them</p></li><li readability=0><p>Due to its purifying ingredients, these strips easily removed debris and excess oils from our skin</p></li><li readability=0><p>This pack is relatively low-cost, coming in at around $1 per strip</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Charcoal is a popular ingredient for removing excess oil and impurities from the skin, and this pore strip does just that. Our tester said the strip "adhered to [her] nose very well" and that there are "slit cut outs that allowed for a more custom fit." She said, "The small slits allowed for the strip to fit snuggly and contour my nose more than other strips I've used in the past."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">She appreciated how comfortable the strip was, and said it was "stiff, but not restrictive." The removal proved simple without any discomfort, redness, or irritation. Our tester noticed some residue from the charcoal, but it was cleaned off without issue. There were many filaments on the strip once removed, showing its effectiveness in pulling up dirt from the pores.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">"I was surprised at how much I liked this strip.

For instance, many pore strips seek to pull oil and dirt from the skin, so if your skin is oily/combination type, you may find more gunk on your strip after use. Those with dry/normal skin may not have as much buildup, but it varies person to person. Of course, sensitive skin can affect your ability to use certain pore strips, so being mindful of products that cause redness/irritation should be front of mind.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Dr. Rabach cautions those with delicate skin from using "acids, retinols, or otherwise… because they can be too rough." She says to "never use on damaged, sunburned, or irritated skin" and to avoid "sensitive areas like the eye." Our best overall pick works well with sensitive skin (as well as normal!) making it a versatile choice for all skin types.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Shape</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Many pore strips are designed with your nose in mind since that's where the bulk of oil and grime builds up throughout the day. These strips are shaped with an almost wavy design to fit the contours of your nose. However, there are also pore strips designed for other areas of the face — such as the T zone (forehead, chin) and cheeks. These strips usually have a rectangular design to cover the most surface area and lift oil from your skin.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Ingredients</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Dr. Rabach explains the different ingredients you might find in these beauty patches. "There are so many different materials that you can find in pore strips. Most aim at debulking clogged pores and removing excess oil, sebum, extra skin and makeup," she says. "Some pore strips are made with Hydrocolloid materials that are more helpful for bigger pimples. And some pore strips are really more like an adhesive that pulls out the extra gunk. There are a lot of different materials that are sometimes added to pore strips depending on what you're looking for and also your skin type." She adds that charcoal can be added "to purify the skin", retinols can "reduce pores and prevent breakouts'', and salicylic acid can help "dry up active pimples."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Jhett Thompson</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-we-tested></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How We Tested</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">A group of beauty testers spent the day sticking the best pore strips on their faces to test each for efficacy, comfort, and any irritation. After trying 14 different strips, our testers had thoroughly refreshed pores and six clear winners. To test the pore strips, our testers each prepared their skin by washing the section of their face that they'd be using the strip on. Then they applied the strips, following the instructions closely for the most accurate results.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">To evaluate the strips, they determined how comfortable the strips were when applied. Did they pull on the skin when adhering? How easy was the removal? They checked for redness and irritation after pulling off the strip to measure its efficacy for sensitive skin. Then they looked to see what the strip cleaned out of their pores, and how fresh their pores looked after use.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-faqs></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>FAQs</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Are pore strips good for your skin?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">According to dermatologists — not always. "Pore strips aren't necessarily good for your skin," says Dr. Rabach. "They have their place in blackhead removal as a quick and easy way to pull blackheads off fast, but pore strips can definitely be harsh and cause irritation, tears, or sensitivity." Basically, if you have normal skin, pore strips are an easy way to remove skin debris without too much effort, but if you are recently sunburned, have easily irritated skin, or any skin allergies, you should take caution before reaching for one of these strips.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Do pore strips actually work?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The Magic Eight Ball says yes! (And so does our dermatologist!) "I would say they do work for removing stubborn blackheads especially on the nose, T zone, and chin," says Dr. Rabach. They may not transform your skin overnight, but they can definitely reduce the size of pores (by helping them open up and release any trapped gunk) and help with acne prone skin by lifting excess oil.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How often should you use pore strips?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As Dr. Rabach mentions, pore strips — when overused or used on damaged skin — can cause minor skin irritations, so you shouldn't use pore strips more than once a week, she says.
