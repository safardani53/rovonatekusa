And apparently, both men and women were huge fans of his physique.</p><p>Other than that, Weatherford also has short black hair and dark brown eyes.</p><h2>Early Life and Education- What position did Steve play?</h2><p>Now talking about his education, Steve went to Terre Haute North Vigo High School in Terre Haute, Indiana.</p><p>Athletically gifted, Steve played football, soccer, track, and even basketball and earned thirteen varsity letters. Also, he was both the punter, kicker, and safety in football.</p><p>During his high school career, Steve set records for the most field goals in a job: longest punting average and longest field goal made. Similarly, as a kicker, Weatherford’s attempts and connections were well-made and received.</p><p>Because of it, he was named to the All-Conference team and even earned All-State honors as a kicker not once but twice.

He finished his college years with a career average of 43.6 yards per punt.</p><p>Moreover, Weatherford placed 3rd in the heptathlon at the 2005 Big Ten Indoor T&F Championships, setting a record in the track and field with 5,365 points.</p><h2>Professional Career- New Orleans Saints and New York Jets</h2><p>After graduating with stellar college records, Weatherford was signed as an undrafted free agent on April 20, 2006, by New Orleans. With the Saints, Weatherford played 16 games, punting 77 times for an average of 43.8 yards per unit, ranking 15th in the NFL.</p><p>Before the Saints released him on October 20, 2008, he recorded two solo tackles and a 15-yard rush for a first down. After that, Weatherford joined two teams: Kansas City Chiefs and Jacksonville Jaguars within a year from 2008 to 2009.</p><p>Finally, on September 7, 2009, Steve was signed by the New York Jets as a team punter. But due to his irregular heartbeat, Steve failed to play in the Jet’s first playoff game.</p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brynn Cameron Age, Brother, Matt Leinart, Husband, Kids, Salary, Instagram >></a></h4><p>Likewise, in March 2010, Steve underwent cardiac ablation at Morristown Memorial Hospital, located in New Jersey. The following seasons, new as a leaf, Weatherford tied the record for most punts inside the 20-yard line in a single season with 42.</p><h2>New York Giants and return to the Jets</h2><p>Despite not being drafted, Steve was signed by teams like New York Giants.</p><p>The team took in Weatherford on July 29, 2011, and there too, the Indiana-born punter kept making records. In the 2011 regular season, Weatherford recorded a punt average of 45.7 yards with a net punt average of 39.2.</p><p>Aside from his games and play, Steve was also lauded for his physique and stamina during the game. This led the young hunk to appear in the December 2011 issue of Men’s Fitness, where his workout routines were included.</p><p>According to the article, Weatherford squats 475 lbs and does almost 400 lbs bench press. No wonder his teammates call him the “strongest player pound-for-pound” on the team.</p><p>Likewise, with the Giants, Steve won his first Super Bowl title in Super Bowl XLVI after defeating the New England Patriots by 21-17. In the game, Steve recorded 40.8 yards per punt, which eventually led to an intentional grounding penalty by <strong>Tom Brady.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/steve-004.jpg><p>After the 2011 season, Weatherford extended his contract with the Giants and signed a five-year deal worth <strong>$12.75 million.</strong></p><p>Following his contract termination with the Jets in 2015, Weatherford re-signed with the Jets as the starting punter. Ryan<strong>&nbsp;Quigley</strong> injured his right shin seven weeks before their match against the New England Patriots.</p><p>Despite his leg infection, Steve played one last match with the Jets. And for playing this one game, he was reportedly paid <strong>$51,176.</strong></p><h2>Other Ventures- Broadcasting and Philanthropy</h2><p>Aside from being a phenomenal punter, Steve is also a broadcaster who graduated from the seventh annual NFL Broadcast Boot Camp back in June 2013.</p><p>Since then, he has filled in as a substitute for sports channels like Good Day New York, ESPN SportsNation, NFLAM, and SI Now.</p><p>Likewise, his broadcasting ventures have led him to star in television, sports magazine, and anything related to sports: fitness, philanthropy- you name it.</p><p>Talking about philanthropy, Steve has established numerous charities in his hometown, Indiana. Some of them are ‘Rush the Punter’ and ‘Kicks for Kids.’</p><p>In 2013, Weatherford was appointed as the Health and Fitness Ambassador of the Boys and Girls Club. There he serves as a role model, mentor, and coach to around 80,000 kids from New Jersey.</p><p>Moreover, his other charities also involve serving as a spokesperson for Second Chance Toys, Breast Cancer Research Foundation, and The Steve Weatherford Charity for Ghana, to name some.</p><p>Not to mention, Steve did not even leave a chance to take his place in the invention of healthy drinks.

Thus, he was mocked by people when he thought of becoming a professional athlete.</p><p>Who knew the urge would lead him to become a franchise player, a Super Bowl Champion? The factors that led him to achieve this were all his hard work and dedication.</p><p>Steve made a plan, woke up early at 6 am to do the lifts, practice, and then go on his own to the YMCA and do more lifts. He maintained this schedule for years and converted it into his favor.</p><p>This held him into 10 years of productive NFL career as one of the fittest players. He might have ended in 2015, but his desire to work on his body gets more and more.</p><p>Steve looked at his forearms and found them too small. Thus, he started with the 90-day ARMageddon workout- an arm-specific program that Weatherford formulated himself.</p><p>And after full three months of massive workout, Steve realized a wholesome change; he increased his forearm size from 16.75 inches to 19 inches.</p><p>Steve will also release the 90-day ARMageddon workout in the form of an e-book; what an interesting way to stick with his fans.</p><h2>How much is Steve Weatherford worth?- Net Worth and Salary</h2><p>For someone who has earned his name in football history without being undrafted is almost unthinkable.

Not to mention, the house also has a garage for three cars. The house is located on Windsor Road in Tenafly.</p><p>Sadly, Weatherford was sued for <strong>$60,000</strong> in bank rent and for damaging the property.</p><h2>Is Steve Weatherford married?
