And together with Susie and brother Pake, Reba formed a musical group, the Singing McEntires, while they were still kids.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>In the group, the legendary singer was&nbsp;the ringleader, where she played guitar and wrote songs.&nbsp;One of the songs, entitled 'The Ballad of John McEntire,' was dedicated to their grandfather,&nbsp;John McEntire,&nbsp;commemorating his&nbsp;achievements.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>But what are her siblings up to at present? Here's all you need to know! <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Reba McEntire’s Sister Susie McEntire-Eaton Is Also a Singer</h2><p>As stated earlier, Reba's sister&nbsp;Susie, born Martha Susan, also grew up learning and practicing music&nbsp;alongside her siblings.</p><p>In the early part of her life, she worked behind her successful sister Reba, touring in various shows and concerts. She also lent&nbsp;her voice for Reba's 1981 album Heart to Heart and its 1982 follow-up Unlimited.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>But after she got married to her ex-husband&nbsp;Paul Luchsinger circa the early '90s,&nbsp;she launched her solo career with 1993's 'Real Love,' which notched no less than four chart-topping hits on the Positive Country charts. Her subsequent songs include 'Come as You Are' in 1995 and 'Raised on Faith' in 1999. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Sometime later, she separated from&nbsp;Paul; and again got tied the knot with another man, but her second marriage also ended very soon. From her previous relationships, she had three children.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Fortunately for her, she found love in&nbsp;Mark Eaton,&nbsp;a native of Washington State, whom she has been married to since December 2009. With him, she is now actively <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">involved in social welfare works</a> and non-profit organizations.</p><h2>Another Sister Alice Foran Is a Social Worker</h2><p>Unlike Reba and Susie, the singer's older sister Alice is not very popular and prefers to stay low-key. Most importantly, she is not involved with any sort of&nbsp;musical works.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">According to&nbsp;Reba</a> — written in her book entitled Reba —&nbsp;Alice is the county director of the Atoka, Oklahoma, Department of Human Services. "Alice is the rock, the one you can call at three in the morning, and she’ll always be ready to help in any way," she added.</p><p>The oldest&nbsp;McEntire sister is married to&nbsp;Robert, and together, they have four kids:&nbsp;Vince, Garett, Trevor, and Haley.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><h2>Brother Pake McEntire Had a Stroke in 2015</h2><p>Pake, born&nbsp;Dale Stanley McEntire, also started his career as a musician. But when his group with his sisters&nbsp;disbanded, she formed his own band,&nbsp;Limestone Gap, which played weekly at the famous Corral Club in Sulphur, Texas.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p>In addition to music, the only son of the family reportedly had an interest in ranching and even sold&nbsp;insurance for some time.</p><p>In 2015, however, Pake <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">suffered a stroke</a> when he was having a&nbsp;routine back surgery. Because of an untimely stroke, it&nbsp;caused blood on the brain and swelling. But later, Reba informed her fans through her Instagram post on May 18, 2015, that her brother was resting and recovering.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Pake also has a family consisting of three daughters:&nbsp;Autumn, Calamity, and Chism.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJyfmsBuvsSbmGalk5q7tbXRnmShmaaaeqJ50qKqrZ2iYq5uuM6oomahnqm8bsDHnmSlnZeau6Wt0bJkrKGenLKzedJmnZqlmaHGb7TTpqM%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./sonny-digital-19910305-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Sonny Digital (Music Producer) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./david-mallett-19510421-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>David Mallett (Songwriter) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-offensive-t-shirts-that-have-been-removed-from-stores.html>15 Most Offensive T-Shirts Ever</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./extreme-makeover-jillian-harris-edition.html>Extreme Makeover: Jillian Harris Edition!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lizzy-mcalpine-tour-2022-how-buy-tickets.html>Lizzy McAlpine tour 2022: How can I buy tickets?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nichole-lynel.html>Nichole Lynel</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./teddy-afro.html>Teddy Afro</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 LoopBlog.
