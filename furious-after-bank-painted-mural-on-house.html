It would be criminal damage.</p><p>"I am fine with graffiti and murals, but what I don't want to see it being used for is an advertising space."</p><p>Peter owns the section of the wall where the QR code, information sign and Natwest logo is painted.</p><p>"It is an art wall. It's known for that. I have no objection to Rashford, I have no objection to the art, but I do object to an advert where I haven't been contacted at all."</p><p>Natwest said the space was purchased in good faith for the campaign and they were unaware the wall did not entirely belong to just one owner.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Football</h2></p><p>The bank commissioned Brighton artist Rose Walker to design an advert for the space, which depicted <a href=#>Manchester United</a> footballer and philanthropist Marcus Rashford both as a child and now with the caption: "Believe it, Become it."</p><p>The landlord added: "My back wall is now an advert for Natwest. You'd think they would have had the decency to go 'Oh, hang on a minute'."</p><p>Peter, 75, fears the advert will also attract antisocial behaviour such as graffiti to his back door.</p><p>He has already had to repaint it since the advert was painted.</p><p>"Especially after all the fury about the politicians, people have ruined my front door," he said.</p><p>It is understood Natwest has apologised and has reached a resolution with Peter.</p><p>A source close to Natwest said the artist was unaware that part of the wall had different ownership.</p><p>A spokesperson said: "The space was purchased in good faith for the campaign to showcase a fantastic piece of work from a local artist.</p><p>"Unfortunately, the media owner was unaware that part of the wall had changed ownership since the space had last been used.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>"Obviously, we were keen to make this right and the media owner contacted the property owner immediately to come to a resolution they were happy with.</p><p>"We’re pleased to confirm the mural will remain until August 20 as planned."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZH90gJdrb3BrX5vCs7XOrqpmmZapsrN5wZqlpGWglravwMSdZKatopa5brvNZp%2BoraOafA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./teen-mom-fans-jenelle-evans-pregnant-tubes-tied.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Teen Mom fans believe Jenelle Evans is pregnant as she shows off 'bump' in new pic- but star says 'I</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./chaka-khan-spouses-children.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Everything To Know About Chaka Khans Spouses And Children</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-offensive-t-shirts-that-have-been-removed-from-stores.html>15 Most Offensive T-Shirts Ever</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./extreme-makeover-jillian-harris-edition.html>Extreme Makeover: Jillian Harris Edition!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lizzy-mcalpine-tour-2022-how-buy-tickets.html>Lizzy McAlpine tour 2022: How can I buy tickets?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nichole-lynel.html>Nichole Lynel</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./teddy-afro.html>Teddy Afro</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 LoopBlog.
