He carries a 6lb penalty for that but is clearly improving and Ryan Moore takes over today. He has handled soft and quick ground.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>MONSIEUR KODI </strong>deserves a good win after a run of placed efforts. He scored at Thirsk in June and has gone close twice since off this mark. All ground comes the same and Richard Fahey’s horses are running well.</p><h3>LEG 2:&nbsp;Mr Curiosity, Sweet William</h3><p><strong>MR CURIOSITY </strong>looks to be crying out for this trip after getting up on the line in good company over 1m4f last time. There was some cut in the ground there so it will be fine if it’s still a little on the testing side on the Downs. A 3lb rise for that last success gives Tim Easterby’s hope every chance.</p><p><strong>SWEET WILLIAM </strong>is progressing too and enjoyed the step up to two miles when winning a decent Newbury handicap 14 days ago. Rab Havlin had the luxury of easing him down so a 7lb rise in the weights should not put the brakes on.</p><h3>LEG 3:&nbsp;Luisa Casati, River Of Stars</h3><p><strong>LUISA</strong> <strong>CASATI</strong> was impressive when winning a Listed contest over course and distance two starts ago ahead of Time Lock. She relished the cut in the ground and should have similar conditions here. Everything went wrong at Haydock last time when the blindfold came off late meaning she badly missed the kick. She can bounce back.</p><p><strong>RIVER OF STARS </strong>was a good York winner in May and matched that form when a close second at Longchamp last time. A repeat of that gives her a big say.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Horse Racing</h2></p><h3>LEG 4:&nbsp;Orazio, Aleezdancer&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3><p><strong>ORAZIO </strong>comes from Charles Hills who has won this race twice with well-backed runners in recent seasons. His four-year-old has a massive chance on ground that should be ideal. He kicked off this season with a smooth win in tacky ground at Newmarket before a much-improved effort at Ascot in May. He was far from disgraced when sixth in the Wokingham on ground that was too quick for him.&nbsp;</p><p>If the wet forecast is right, mudlark <strong>ALEEZDANCER </strong>has a big each-way chance. He was a good winner off a 3lb higher mark in testing ground at Donny and hasn’t had those conditions since.</p><h3>LEG 5:&nbsp;Chartwell House, New Business&nbsp;</h3><p><strong>CHARTWELL HOUSE </strong>is consistent over this trip and was an impressive winner at Haydock two runs ago. He was hiked up the weights for that but showed he could cope with his new mark when a close second at the Merseyside track last time. He has gone well on both fast and slow ground and the excellent Neil Callan gets on board again.</p><p><strong>NEW BUSINESS </strong>was backed before his handicap debut at Sandown last month but had to settle for a fair fourth. She was very keen there and Ryan Moore taking over on top will do her no harm.</p><h3>LEG 6:&nbsp;Individualism, Devil’s Point</h3><p><strong>INDIVIDUALISM </strong>can take advantage of his experience to score for Charlie Johnston. This son of Too Darn Hot made a good start when a close-up second at Ayr on debut. His classy half-brother Subjectivist won over this 7f trip as a juvenile and Joe Fanning’s mount can progress from his debut.</p><p><strong>DEVIL’S POINT </strong>was beaten just over a length on debut at Sandown and is another contender for the capable David Menuisier.</p><h3 class=has-text-align-center>Tote:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bet £5 Get £20 in free bets*</a></h3><h2><strong>Remember to gamble responsibly</strong></h2><p><strong>A responsible gambler is someone who:</strong></p><ul><li>Establishes time and monetary limits before playing</li><li>Only gambles with money they can afford to lose</li><li>Never chase their losses</li><li>Doesn’t gamble if they’re upset, angry, or depressed</li><li>Gamcare –&nbsp;<a href=#>www.gamcare.org.uk</a></li><li>Gamble Aware –&nbsp;<a href=#>www.begambleaware.org</a></li></ul><p>For help with a gambling problem, call the National Gambling Helpline on 0808 8020 133 or go to&nbsp;<a href=#>www.gamstop.co.uk</a>&nbsp;to be excluded from all UK-regulated gambling websites.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZLWwvtKeqZqbmaO0cH6Sa21qb2VufKi4zqugqK2jYrSwu8OwpqicXam8tbGMqaOam5WlvLV5x6iprJ1dp66ktc2gZK2hoKh8</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kate-middleton-wears-fur-hats-beanies-in-sweden-and-norway.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kate Middleton Wears Fur Hats, Beanies in Sweden and Norway</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./does-f1-22-have-crossplay.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Does 'F1 22' Have Crossplay Support at Launch?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-offensive-t-shirts-that-have-been-removed-from-stores.html>15 Most Offensive T-Shirts Ever</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./extreme-makeover-jillian-harris-edition.html>Extreme Makeover: Jillian Harris Edition!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lizzy-mcalpine-tour-2022-how-buy-tickets.html>Lizzy McAlpine tour 2022: How can I buy tickets?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nichole-lynel.html>Nichole Lynel</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./teddy-afro.html>Teddy Afro</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 LoopBlog.
