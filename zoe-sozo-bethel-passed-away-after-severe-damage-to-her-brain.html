The beauty queen was killed in Miami barely eight days after suffering from an unknown brain injury that she did not disclose on social media. The Instagram post was published only a day ago. It said: Miss Alabama suffered a “serious brain/brainstem injury,” according to the family’s social media post. The tragedy happened on February 10, 2022, and she was in a coma until February 18, 2022. Following her death, her family issued the following statement:</p><p>“This has been a shocking and devastating circumstance for our family, and we can only image how shocking it would be for everyone who knows and cares about her.”</p><p>The Miami policy does not allow information on Zoe Bethel’s accident to be made public.</p><h2>How old was Zoe Sozo?</h2><p><strong>At the time of her death, Zoe Bethel was 27 years old</strong>. In addition to winning the contest, she worked as a Right Side Broadcasting Network reporter and as the executive producer and brand ambassador for Miss Liberty USA. Bethel was a single mother. She has volunteered with groups such as Turning Point USA, the anti-abortion group Students for Life, Project Veritas, and Liberty University’s Falkirk Center as a conservative pundit.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Zoe-Sozo-Bethel-2.jpg alt="Zoe Sozo Bethel" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>In addition to becoming a reporter, she had an interest in modeling. However, she was sacked from her agency in 2018 due to her political opinions. According to Fox News, Ursula Wiedmann Models informed her through email that they would be unable to work with her due to her “racist political affiliations.”&nbsp;Despite dealing with employment issues, she was liked by many.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Zoe Bethel. If you were lucky enough to know her, you loved her. Even if you never met her but got the chance to follow her work over the years, you felt like you knew her. She just had that big of a personality. She was so incredibly bold in her beliefs and values.</p><p>💔💔💔</p><p>1/3 <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/DSJhP3PAWP</a></p><p>— The Truth Gazette (@Truth_Gazette) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">February 18, 2022</a></p><h2>To fund medical expenditures, the family launches a GoFundMe campaign.</h2><p>Santiago Roman started a campaign five days ago to pay Zoe Bethel’s medical fees since she didn’t have health insurance. He held the movement to pay for “current treatments performed, future life-sustaining medication, recuperation and therapy (if required), burial and memorial expenditures (if applicable), and resources for Zoe’s daughter.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Zoe-Sozo-Bethel-3.jpg alt="Zoe Sozo Bethel" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Since her death, the fundraising effort has not been updated.
