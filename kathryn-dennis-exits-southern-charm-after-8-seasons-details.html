That was in 2013, and in the decade that followed, it’s safe to say my life changed in ways I could never imagine. It hasn’t always been easy, but I’m so lucky to have had reality cameras there, capturing so many moments that I’ll never forget (and a few, even, that I’d like to).”</p><p class="x_p3 x_FluidPluginCopy x_ContentPasted0">The model, who has been part cast since the show’s inception in 2014, thanked fans for watching her “grow up” and become a “mom to two amazing children and build friendships I’ll always treasure.” Dennis shares daughter Kensington Calhoun, 8, and son Saint Julian, 6, with former castmate<a href=#> <strong>Thomas Ravenel</strong></a>, who appeared on seasons 1 through 6 of the reality series before <a href=#>exiting amid sexual assault allegations</a>. The former politician settled the lawsuit filed against him in 2019. (Ravenel, 60, also shares son Jonathan, 2, with ex <a href=#><strong>Heather Mascoe</strong></a>.)</p><p class="x_p3 x_FluidPluginCopy x_ContentPasted0">She continued, “Through it all, the love y’all have shown for me not only gave me the strength I needed to tackle it all, but helped me realize that I wasn’t alone. I’m so grateful. “I’ll be carrying that love with me as I enter this next chapter of my life, away from the&nbsp;Southern Charm&nbsp;lens. I’m thankful for Bravo, the producers at Haymaker and my Charleston cast mates for everything.”</p><p class="x_p3 x_FluidPluginCopy x_ContentPasted0">The South Carolina native explained that while she’ll miss her time on the hit&nbsp;Bravo series, she is excited to see what the next chapter might bring. “If it’s anything like the last decade, it’ll be a memorable ride. LFG [let’s f–king go],” she concluded her statement.</p><p class="x_p3 x_FluidPluginCopy x_ContentPasted0">News of Dennis’ exit comes one day after<a href=#> Deadline</a> reported that she would <a href=#>be billed as a guest star</a> on Southern Charm’s upcoming ninth season. The mom of two initially began the series as a part-time cast member<b class=x_ContentPasted0>&nbsp;</b>but was<b>&nbsp;</b>upgraded to series regular in season 2 after she and Ravenel&nbsp;sparked a romance.</p><p class="x_p3 x_FluidPluginCopy x_ContentPasted0">Season 8 of the show followed Dennis’ latest relationship with now-ex <a href=#><strong>Chleb&nbsp;Ravenell</strong></a>.<b class=x_ContentPasted0>&nbsp;</b>The pair were first linked in 2020 but called it quits during production.</p><p class="x_p3 x_FluidPluginCopy x_ContentPasted0">“Every time we would film, it’d just be an argument,” Ravenell, 34, exclusively told&nbsp;Us Weekly&nbsp;in July 2022 <a href=#>about watching their romance and breakup on the show</a>. “It was getting petty. So we were just like, ‘You know what? We should just break this off.’”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class="x_p3 x_FluidPluginCopy x_ContentPasted0">He added, “She wasn’t telling me what she was going through. She was telling me she was going through like court cases and stuff where her kids and custody battles [were involved] … She wasn’t telling me about her relationships [with the cast]. I was just coming in blind, helping her. And then it kind of just all fell on me.”</p><p class="x_p3 x_FluidPluginCopy x_ContentPasted0">It hasn’t been confirmed if the Ravenell will appear on season 9 of Southern Charm, which also stars <a href=#><strong>Craig Conover</strong></a>,&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Shep Rose</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Austen Kroll</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Venita Aspen</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Leva Bonaparte</strong></a>. <a href=#><strong>Naomie Olindo</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Madison LeCroy</strong></a> and Summer House’s <a href=#><strong>Paige DeSorbo</strong></a>, who is dating 33-year-old Conover, also had heavily featured roles in season 8.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKKarJinxq95w56lp6GjYrK5tdOsZKynpam1pr7NZpqhmaKieqKy056pZnBdqLKiv86nqmaclamuqrjSaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kylie-jenner-and-tyga-in-bed-video.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kylie Jenner &amp;amp; Tyga in Bed Video</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jordan-mechner-19640604-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jordan Mechner (Inventor) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-offensive-t-shirts-that-have-been-removed-from-stores.html>15 Most Offensive T-Shirts Ever</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./extreme-makeover-jillian-harris-edition.html>Extreme Makeover: Jillian Harris Edition!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lizzy-mcalpine-tour-2022-how-buy-tickets.html>Lizzy McAlpine tour 2022: How can I buy tickets?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nichole-lynel.html>Nichole Lynel</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./teddy-afro.html>Teddy Afro</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 LoopBlog.
