The last round of qualifiers went down on September 19 as 11 more acts took the stage in hopes of earning America’s vote. A day later on September 20, the final three acts to make it to the season 18 finale were announced. <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Reba McEntire</strong></a> also performed ahead of her debut as a coach on <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Voice</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>The top 5 acts of the final round of qualifiers were the <strong>82nd Airborne Division Chorus</strong>, <strong>Sangsoon Kim</strong>,<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong> Gabriel Henrique</strong></a>, <strong>Ramadhani Brothers</strong>, and<strong> Avantgardey</strong>. The acts were narrowed down to the top 3: 82nd Airborne Division Chorus,&nbsp;Ramadhani Brothers, and Gabriel. At the end of the night, the 82nd Airborne Division Chorus was voted into the finals along with the Ramadhani Brothers after America’s votes came in. However, there was one more spot left open for the Instant Save vote.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Each of the judges chose an act to be put up for the Instant Save vote. The judges picked <strong>Chioma and The Atlanta Drum Academy</strong>, <strong>Herwan Legaillard</strong>, Avantgardey, and Gabriel. In the end, Avantgardey won the&nbsp;wildcard Instant Vote.</p><h2>Avantgardey</h2><p id=content-paragraph-5>Avantgardey got the second chance of a lifetime when <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Howie Mandel </strong></a>nominated the group for the Instant Save. The Japanese dance group captivated America from the moment they stepped onto the AGT stage. Following their electrifying qualifiers performance, Howie told the group, “You are so original. You are my favorite in the dance act. You deserve to go to the finals”</p><h2>Ramadhani Brothers</h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>The Ramadhani Brothers are definitely one of the best acrobat duos AGT has ever seen. The head-balancing act wowed the judges once again with their qualifiers performance. <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Simon Cowell</strong></a> raved over the “spellbinding” performance. “In my opinion, this is an act that should be in the final, and I believe is a million-dollar act.” When the Ramadhani Brothers made the season 18 finale, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Heidi Klum</strong></a>&nbsp;told the duo that they are “one of the best acts we have ever witnessed.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ramadhani-brothers-embed-.jpg><h2>82nd Airborne Division Chorus</h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>The military-based a capella group has been one of the most inspiring acts of season 18. The singing troupe wowed with their rendition of <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Pink’s</strong></a> “I Am Here” during the qualifiers. “It was fun and emotive. For me, this was a moment,” Simon said. Howie called the performance “perfect.” He also took a moment to thank them for their service, “We are here because you are here. Without you, we couldn’t do what we do.”</p><h2>Ana Deguzman</h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>The female magician continues to prove that she’s a force to be reckoned with in season 18. She stunned the judges and the crowd with her latest performance. “We need more female magicians. That’s all I can say,” Heidi&nbsp;declared. <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Sofia Vergara</strong></a>&nbsp;added that Ana has a “big career” ahead of her in magic.</p><h2>Chibi Unity</h2><p id=content-paragraph-9>The Japanese dance group brought their A-game for the qualifiers round on Sept. 12. “I could watch you guys perform for hours,” Sofia said. “It’s surprising. It’s sexy. It’s so artsy. I can tell how much work, how much passion you put into this.” Simon&nbsp;said the troupe is “one of the best acts” of the season.</p><h2>Putri Ariani</h2><p id=content-paragraph-10><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Putri Ariani</strong></a> became an instant frontrunner after her audition. The blind singer’s first AGT performance went viral and captured the world. She returned for the qualifiers on September 6 and performed a gorgeous rendition of <strong>U2’s</strong> “I Still Haven’t Found What I’m Looking For.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/agt-qualifiers-update-embed-.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-11>The judges raved over her performance, and Simon admitted he was nearly “speechless.” Simon was the one who gave Putri his coveted Golden Buzzer earlier in the season. Sofia&nbsp;gushed, “I don’t think I’ve ever heard something more beautiful in my life. That was spectacular.” Putri is one step closer to becoming the next AGT champion.</p><h2>Mzansi Youth Choir</h2><p id=content-paragraph-12><strong>Mzansi Youth Choir</strong> earned the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>first Golden Buzzer of season 18</a>, and the show’s first-ever audience Golden Buzzer. The group moved the judges with their tribute to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>late AGT alum <strong>Nightbirde</strong></a> during their audition. The choir dazzled with their cover of <strong>Fleetwood Mac’s</strong> “Everywhere” for the qualifiers. After making it to the finals, Howie told the group, “You moved America, [and] you’re moving the world.”</p><h2>Lavender Darcangelo</h2><p id=content-paragraph-13><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Lavender Darcangelo</strong></a> was among the first two contestants to make it to the season 18 finals. The singer, who is blind and autistic, has dazzled the judges and America from her very first performance. She earned <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Heidi Klum’s</strong> Golden Buzzer</a> after her show-stopping audition performance of <strong>Irena Cara’s</strong> “Out Here On My Own.” Her audition video went viral and has over 4 million views on YouTube.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/lavender-agt-embed-1-.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-14>For her qualifiers performance, Lavender sang an incredible rendition of <strong>Foreigner’s</strong> “I Wanna Know What Love Is.” The judges gave her a standing ovation. Simon&nbsp;praised her “beautiful” performance.</p><h2>Adrian Stoica & Hurricane</h2><p id=content-paragraph-15><strong>Adrian Stoica & Hurricane</strong> stole our hearts with their adorable dog act. Adrian and Hurricane returned to the stage with another fun and lovable routine. Howie declared that Adrian & Stoica & Hurricane is “favorite dog act ever on AGT.” Heidi admitted that it’s “mind-blowing” to her how Adrian pulls off his act.</p><h2>Ahren Belisle</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ahren-belisle-embed-3.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-16><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Ahren Belisle</strong></a> is one of the most original comics in AGT’s history. The comedian is mute and uses a text-to-speech app in his stand-up routines. Ahren was funnier than ever in his latest performance. He brought his dog along for the ride, too. He hilariously hit on <strong>Sofia Vergara</strong> and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>accidentally called her “Sofia Viagra.”</a></p><h2>Murmuration</h2><p id=content-paragraph-17><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Murmuration</strong> was Howie’s Golden Buzzer</a> act this season. The dancers returned to the AGT stage for a powerful and truly stunning performance during the season 18 qualifiers. Simon raved that their performance was “literally perfection” and said Murmuration was “in a different league to anything we’ve seen so far.” Now they’re headed to the finals!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8CmnKuhk5bAbrPOrWStmZyau7V50p6YrKeeYn55edGeqq6kpKh6orPTZqiumZyes6qx0axkbmlla4N5gI4%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./inside-jason-and-kylie-kelces-connection-to-eagles-autism-foundation.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Inside Jason and Kylie Kelce's Connection to Eagles Autism Foundation</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./katie-thurston-bachelorette-finale-drinking-game.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Play This Drinking Game During Katie Thurston's 'Bachelorette' Finale</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-offensive-t-shirts-that-have-been-removed-from-stores.html>15 Most Offensive T-Shirts Ever</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./extreme-makeover-jillian-harris-edition.html>Extreme Makeover: Jillian Harris Edition!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lizzy-mcalpine-tour-2022-how-buy-tickets.html>Lizzy McAlpine tour 2022: How can I buy tickets?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nichole-lynel.html>Nichole Lynel</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./teddy-afro.html>Teddy Afro</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 LoopBlog.
