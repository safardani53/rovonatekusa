To me, it felt like he crossed it in that quip."</p><p>Another wrote: "That's a good example of something that Alex could get away with because he was Alex, but could be taken the wrong way coming from someone else."</p><p>A third wrote: "What is the point of saying that to a contestant? It's not really a humorous comment.</p><p>"It's not like the contestant was someone like&nbsp;<a href=#>James</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=#>Brad</a>, who we know are great and could take a little ribbing if they said something dumb.</p><p>"It came midway in the first round, Sharon was still trying to get underway and might have still been a bit nervous.</p><p>"The host can think a response was poor, but why draw attention to it from a new contestant?"</p><p>A fourth agreed: "This is a nuance of hosting. There's a time and a place for snark and sarcasm. This probably wasn't the best use of it.”</p><p>That said, Sharon had a second flat-out rough guess during the first round of the game.</p><p>A clue read: “In 2014 Decatur, Texas, rescheduled this holiday back to the 30th, as it conflicted with Friday night high school football.”</p><p>“What is football?” Sharon answered.</p><p>One fan joked on Twitter: "Oh my god she's on fire."</p><p>Sharon still had an impressive performance after that, winding up with $17,000 in <a href=#>Final Jeopardy</a> even though she didn't win.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p><a href=#>Lucas Partridge</a> won what was his third win with $66,200 total.</p><p>He will <a href=#>spend the summer as the&nbsp;Jeopardy!&nbsp;champion</a> and return - along with&nbsp;<a href=#>Season 40</a> - on September 11.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/07/contestant-breaks-silence-incorrect-guess-835366962.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/07/fans-shocked-mayim-bialik-debuts-757536913-3.png><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hwZ2iAeH6UaKGep6CWv6XFjJymp6yVqMGiutNmmaudkaDAbr%2FIpZynm5VixqK%2Bw2abmquYYrimuoyjnKemmaO0tHs%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./mychal-kendricks-19900928-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Mychal Kendricks (Football Player) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./iyanna-mcneely-wmei-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Iyanna McNeely (Reality Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-offensive-t-shirts-that-have-been-removed-from-stores.html>15 Most Offensive T-Shirts Ever</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./extreme-makeover-jillian-harris-edition.html>Extreme Makeover: Jillian Harris Edition!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lizzy-mcalpine-tour-2022-how-buy-tickets.html>Lizzy McAlpine tour 2022: How can I buy tickets?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nichole-lynel.html>Nichole Lynel</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./teddy-afro.html>Teddy Afro</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 LoopBlog.
