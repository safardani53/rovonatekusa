It was only when his football career took off that he came into big money and fame.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>But, it must be his lowkey Missouri upbringing that still keeps him down-to-earth to this day. After hanging up his boots in 2015, he's&nbsp;living a quiet life, with the ability to own everything he&nbsp;probably ever wanted.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>Happiness In Hayti</h2><p>Moore had his beginnings in Hayti (pronounced Hey-tie), a small town&nbsp;90 miles north of Memphis. He grew up with his mother and three siblings, and they weren't&nbsp;that well-off as a family. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>They lived in a one-bedroom apartment. And Moore&nbsp;lived there till 2004.</p><p>Living in a small town with nothing much to do, Moore chose sports as a pastime. He was good at both football and basketball but ultimately chose to make a career in football.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>So, in 2004, he went away to the University of Missouri on a football scholarship. But, as Moore recalled it, life wasn't&nbsp;that bad in their tiny apartment. It wasn't much, but it was home. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>His mother made the most out of the little things in life. She kept things neat and made her four kids do the same.&nbsp;Everybody got into trouble when things weren’t in the&nbsp;right place.</p><p>She also was a decorator. She got fancier things for the apartment whenever she found good deals. Making life nice for her children was her goal.</p><h2>Big House for the Family</h2><p>After a spectacular college career at the University of Missouri, it was time for him to step up his game. The <a href=# rel=follow>NFL</a> came calling. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Moore got picked up by the Atlanta Falcons in the second round of the 2009 NFL Draft. His <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">first contract</a> was worth a bit more than $3.4 million.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>It was after his renewal in 2013 that he really made big bucks. On March 9, 2013, he <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">signed a five-year deal</a> with the Falcons worth $32 million.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>It was maybe this money, even though he retired before the contract could reach its maturity, that has endowed him with a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">reported net worth</a> of around $1 million, six years after his retirement. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>One of the things he got with that money was a nice, big house. He splashed a decent amount on a house near Atlanta with all the bells and whistles he wanted.</p><p>However, he remained cautious about overspending, something he might have learned from his mother. While he could spend, he didn't&nbsp;and instead got everything he wanted for less than half the regular price.</p><p>"Why should I spend $2 million on a house when I can just be patient and save over double that and still get what I want?" said Moore during his <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview with HGTV</a>. And he is cautious even to this day. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>He still tries to get good deals on things, even though people tend to charge more when they realize he's&nbsp;rich. He and his girlfriend Brittni take a while longer but find the same things with lower price tags on them.</p><p>That doesn't&nbsp;mean he compromises on important things, though. For example, he doesn't&nbsp;compromise on a good night's&nbsp;sleep and gets the best mattresses and bedding possible within&nbsp;a reasonable spending limit. And he doesn't compromise on what he eats, either.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Also, one&nbsp;thing&nbsp;he didn't think twice about spending money on was a house with an indoor pool and two kitchens. He wanted to get a big house because he wanted family members over during the holidays.</p><p>He wanted two kitchens, one for parties and one for family dinner. And he wanted a big space&nbsp;to host parties, high ceilings, and double front doors, all of which make him happy. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>All this extravaganza, but it doesn't&nbsp;feel overdone for him. He still feels like he's&nbsp;at home.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaK%2BZobmqrcxmpKinopp6rrvToZyrZZikwrSxjaGrpqQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./casey-frey-19930623-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Casey Frey (Instagram Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-barbara-bach-ringo-starr-wife.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is Ringo Starr's Wife?
