Actress <b>Chloë Grace Moretz </b>addressed her crazy Twitter feud with<b> Kim Kardashian</b> in a new interview with<i><a href=#> Glamour</a></i>, and defended her opinion about the reality star’s racy nude Twitter photo<a href=#> that sparked a way-too-involved celebrity feud this past March.</a></p><p>“I had just gotten off a plane from South Korea, I was incredibly jet-lagged, and I couldn’t take one more thing,” Moretz, 19, said of coming across Kardashian’s nude pic. “I saw that photo, and I had to say something. That picture wasn’t linked to body confidence. It wasn’t a #BodyConfidence or #LoveWhoYouAre. It was done in a slightly voyeuristic light, which I felt was a little inappropriate for young women to see … I would hate for young women to feel they need to post certain photos in order to gain likes, retweets, favorites, and male attention.… I wasn’t slut-shaming. It’s not about body shaming.”</p><p><span>The teen <a href=#>memorably tweeted directly at Kardashian</a> at the time, writing: “I truly hope you realize how important setting goals are for young women, teaching them we have so much more to offer than just our bodies.” Four hours later, Kardashian, 35, sniped back: “Let’s all welcome @ChloeGMoretz to twitter, since no one knows who she is.”</span></p><p>The <i>Neighbors 2</i> actress Kardashian’s reaction amusing. “I started laughing,” she recalled. “I was at dinner with my family [when] I got the notification [on my phone]. I look at it and I go, ‘Oh my God. She responded.’ My mom took the most offense to it because it was girl-on-girl hate and Kim didn’t come back with an educated response on body confidence. It was aggressive, and also it was incorrect. I don’t have 45 million followers or a TV show that follows my life. But people know who I am. I pride myself on having opinions, and I don’t express them in snarky ways toward people.”</p><p><img decoding=async src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt width=1000 height=1441 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>The <i>Carrie</i> star wasn’t the only celeb to weigh in on Kardashian’s nude selfie. <b>Bette Midler </b>and <b>Pink </b>also railed against the reality star for posting the provocative pic, while younger stars like<b> Bella Thorne, Ariel Winter </b>and<b> Emily Ratajkowski </b>defended the mom of two. Ultimately, Kardashian<a href=#> explained herself in an open letter on her site</a>.</p><p><span>“I am empowered by my body. I am empowered by my sexuality. I am empowered by feeling comfortable in my skin,” she wrote. “I am empowered by showing the world my flaws and not being afraid of what anyone is going to say about me. And I hope that through this platform I have been given, I can encourage the same empowerment for girls and women all over the world.”</span></p><p>How did Moretz react to that note? “I wish that it had come out earlier. It was a great message,” she told <i>Glamour</i>. “It was just a little late.”</p><p>The former child star has posted a bikini snapshot occasionally — but she told the mag that it’s not to gain attention or likes. “I do it because it’s a body-confidence thing. I posted one in Mexico. I felt good, and I was wearing a bikini on a beach. It wasn’t me sexualizing myself. It was with a beautiful background,” she explained. “When I posted it, I knew that there would be a lot of young women looking. So I made sure that it was tasteful…. I get called prudish.” She added: “I get called names for not showing myself off.”</p><p><img decoding=async src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt width=1000 height=1381 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>According to Moretz, she gets taunted frequently, especially by her <i>Neighbors 2</i> costars. “We were always pulling pranks on each other. They would find all these things that tick my clock—certain people out there really push my buttons—and send me articles and pictures,” she said.</p><p>In fact, Moretz had a very specific description for the type of person who pushes her buttons. “One who appropriates bad gender stereotypes, appropriates a lot of exclusivity, is very rich and niche-y,” she said. “Or someone who overtly tries to be normal, when that’s the opposite of who I know they are.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGacoJyksm6z0ZqanmWdpL%2BmwNlmoqKlXaCus7DArJ%2BimZ5iu7awxGanopujYrOmwcNmpJqclWK6pnnLmqygoF2sf3GBkXBraA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./cy-twombly.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Cy Twombly</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./blake-lively-and-selena-gomez-to-anchor-sex-and-the-city-prequel.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Blake Lively and Selena Gomez to Anchor Sex and the City Prequel?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-offensive-t-shirts-that-have-been-removed-from-stores.html>15 Most Offensive T-Shirts Ever</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./extreme-makeover-jillian-harris-edition.html>Extreme Makeover: Jillian Harris Edition!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lizzy-mcalpine-tour-2022-how-buy-tickets.html>Lizzy McAlpine tour 2022: How can I buy tickets?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nichole-lynel.html>Nichole Lynel</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./teddy-afro.html>Teddy Afro</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 LoopBlog.
