After over seven years together, Adele confirmed that she and her husband, Simon Konecki, would be divorcing.</p>Article continues below advertisement<p>In September 2019, Adele officially filed for divorce from Simon. While most details surrounding their divorce have been kept private, it has been alleged that the relationship ended from “irreconcilable differences.” Many have speculated that it was Adele’s rise to fame and demanding schedule that led to the eventual split.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src>Article continues below advertisement<p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Cosmopolitan</u></a> reported in 2020, “Last year, sources claimed their divorce came after years and years of drifting apart due to increasingly demanding schedules as Adele 'became a bigger and bigger star.' Simon was reportedly content with Adele's fame, but it became more difficult for them to see each other and connect the way they used to.”</p><p>Now that the two have officially split, what does this mean for Adele's bank account? <a href=#>Why did Adele have to pay her husband?</a> The answer goes all the way back to the beginning.</p>Article continues below advertisement<h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why did Adele have to pay her ex-husband? It’s alleged that they didn’t sign a prenup.</h2><p>According to reports from the U.K.’s <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>The Sun</u></a>, the couple did not sign a prenuptial agreement before being wed, so Simon would have ended up receiving half of Adele's fortune.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src>Article continues below advertisement<p>A Los Angeles divorce court judge granted that the details of the divorce would remain private. The Sun also reported that a judge ruled that “financial, sales or other confidential business information” will be kept private, and even the lawyers will need to sign a non-disclosure agreement.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Adele filed for divorce in California.</h2><p>It was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">confirmed by USAToday</a> that Adele filed for divorce in Los Angeles, Calif. which is an important piece to the puzzle. California is a community property state, meaning that earnings made during the marriage may be split 50-50 if there is no prenup in order.&nbsp;</p>Article continues below advertisement<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>People</u></a>, Adele is worth an estimated $182 million, and much of her wealth was acquired during the course of her marriage to Simon. So basically, if there is no prenuptial agreement, anything that Adele earned during the course of their marriage is technically half her husband’s as well.&nbsp;</p>Article continues below advertisement<h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Some don’t think it’s fair that Adele would have to pay that much.</h2><p>Many of Adele’s fans are angry that the 31-year-old singer hypothetically gave up half of her fortune to her husband, implying that he did not do much to deserve it.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>As a man why would you even want to take that much money from your ex wife anyway?
