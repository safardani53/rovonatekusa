of Bad Bunny at COACHELLA," the Hulu star was shown shimmying to the crowd as the reggeaton artist performed on stage.</p><p>Kendall, 27, shuffled back and forth between her bodyguards amid the massive crowd of concert attendees.</p><p>Her fellow revelers appeared to give the Keeping Up With the Kardashians alum space to break a move as she performed a little spin as Bad Bunny, 29, hyped up the crowd.</p><p>Fans weighed in on <a href=#>The Kardashians</a> star's dance moves in the comment section of the posted video with a pair of fans writing: "NOOOO" and "Dry asf" to begin the shade-throwing session.</p><p>Another person commented: "bombastic side eye."</p><p>A third TikTok user simply wrote: "NO."</p><img

"crying" emojis.</p><p>"That little spin though," mentioned a second.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Celebrity</h2></p><p>A third fan wrote: "I’m gonna need wayyyyyyy more energy."</p><p>While a fourth person remarked: "OMFG she’s like a stone dancing."</p><p>Others weren't so judgemental of Kendall's dancing skills, as one commenter wrote: "She looks so cute" as another followed up by stating, "Love her."</p><h2>HOLD YOUR HORSES</h2><p>Earlier this month<a href=#>,</a> <a href=#>Kendall was spotted cuddling with Bad Bunny</a> during a romantic horseback riding date, despite her "desperation" to keep their relationship a secret.</p><p>The TV star has become "overwhelmed" by hate from the singer's devoted fans, a source has exclusively told The U.S. Sun.</p><p>Kendall and&nbsp;Bad Bunny&nbsp;were photographed horsing around at the Hidden Hills Equestrian Center where they rode together and separately while making sure to take plenty of snaps along the way.</p><p>The singer wrapped his arms around Kendall's waist. She sat in front of him as they rode a horse.</p><p>The model wore a white hat and a matching tank top paired with casual jeans.</p><p>The couple smiled for a selfie while enjoying their afternoon together.</p><p>The daytime date comes after the two were spotted making out on a sushi date in Los Angeles.</p><h2>'GETTING STEAMY'</h2><p>The lovebirds reportedly locked lips during their steamy dinner date at Japanese hotspot Sushi Fumi.</p><p>An eyewitness told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Us Weekly</a>&nbsp;that the couple was "openly kissing" on their date and "being very affectionate" toward each other.</p><p>Although the two have been packing on the PDA, an insider close to&nbsp;the former E! star exclusively told&nbsp;The U.S. Sun&nbsp;that&nbsp;Kendall&nbsp;wished her new romance was a bit more private.&nbsp;</p><p>The need for privacy came after the supermodel and the Puerto Rican singer were recently snapped with their lips together after a date at Sushi Park in West Hollywood.</p><p>The musician followed behind the brunette beauty and her security after they finished dining.</p><p>He planted a kiss on the Victoria's Secret model before she jumped into her SUV.</p><p>A source claimed the two are not keen on being pictured engaging in any PDA and have gone to great lengths to avoid photos emerging of them.</p><p>The insider said: "Kendall and&nbsp;Bad Bunny&nbsp;have been hanging out a lot, but they are desperately trying to keep their dates under wraps,"&nbsp;</p><p>"They've been out for coffee and brunch and partying together at friends' houses in recent weeks in&nbsp;Los Angeles; things are getting steamy.</p><p>"But Kendall has been going out of her way to try and stop paparazzi photographs of them together coming out."</p><p>The source continued: "She has been feeling overwhelmed about the relationship because of the hate she got online from a lot of his fans.&nbsp;</p><p>"Kendall wants to try and keep it as private as possible, as she has made no secret of the fact she isn't a fan of public relationships."</p><p>Kendall, who has had problems with trolls in the past, has had to deal with a lot of online hate over getting together with Bad Bunny, with many mocking the fact she doesn't speak Spanish.</p><p>One wrote: "Bad Bunny and Kendall Jenner?!? Not a Kardashian/Jenner coming to ruin another successful celebrity…keep them demons away from Benito!!!" referring to the star's real name.</p><p>A second posted: "BAD BUNNY AND KENDALL JENNER? I THOUGHT HE LIKED SEASONING."&nbsp;</p><p>While another slammed the star, writing: "Benito's taste has always been questionable and inconsistent."</p><h2>THE EX FACTOR</h2><p>Before she appeared with Bad Bunny, Kendall dated NBA star&nbsp;<a href=#>Devin Booker</a>, the shooting guard for the Phoenix Suns.</p><p>The couple reportedly broke up in early 2022 according to sources. An insider told PEOPLE at the time: "Both have incredibly busy schedules right now with their careers and they've decided to make that a priority."</p><p>Bad Bunny allegedly shaded Kendall's ex in Eladio Carrión's new song, Coco Chanel, in which he&nbsp;raps in Spanish&nbsp;about "Scorpio women," seemingly referring to Kendall.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>He says: "The sun in Puerto Rico is hotter than in Phoenix / She knows it," which seems to suggest he's mocking Devin.</p><p>The&nbsp;<a href=#>sportsman appeared to fire back</a>&nbsp;in a post that sent fans into a spin, posting: “He worried about another MAN again.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/04/NINTCHDBPICT000810241409.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/04/kardashian-fans-mock-kendall-jenner-810239917-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/04/kendall-jenner-easter-post-auntie-808898932.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jq2tmqaUqLWww8GisWiblaGyo77IraCeq19nf3GBlXJnaWeblr%2BlrdKhoJqmXZuur7%2BMpqaco12gsq%2BwwKWjZqKVo7umvoydmKebmaO0bq7AnWSbrZ6jxm6vzpqaoZ2coa5w</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-camille-guaty-dating.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Camille Guaty Dating Now</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./happy-valley-classmates-jealous-rhys-connah.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>I've been in Happy Valley since I was 8 - all my classmates were jealous of me for surprising reason</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-offensive-t-shirts-that-have-been-removed-from-stores.html>15 Most Offensive T-Shirts Ever</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./extreme-makeover-jillian-harris-edition.html>Extreme Makeover: Jillian Harris Edition!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lizzy-mcalpine-tour-2022-how-buy-tickets.html>Lizzy McAlpine tour 2022: How can I buy tickets?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nichole-lynel.html>Nichole Lynel</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./teddy-afro.html>Teddy Afro</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 LoopBlog.
