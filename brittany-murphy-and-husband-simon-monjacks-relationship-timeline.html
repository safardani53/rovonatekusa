The couple tied the knot the following year, which surprised many of Murphy’s family and friends, including her King of the Hill costar <a href=#><strong>Kathy Najimy</strong></a>.</p><p>The <a href=#>HBO Max documentary What Happened, Brittany Murphy?</a> takes a closer look at <a href=#>the troubled relationship between the pair</a>, who died within two months of one another. In the two-part film, released in October 2021, Najimy said people in the Sin City actress’ life were <a href=#>“scared and freaked out” by Monjack</a>.</p><p>“Like, who was this guy and what was happening?” the <a href=#>Hocus Pocus</a> actress said in the doc. “She wanted to marry him, and I said, ‘Honey, it’s not been long enough.’”</p><p>Before saying “I do,” Murphy had been involved in high profile romances with her 8 Mile costar <a href=#><strong>Eminem</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Ashton Kutcher</strong></a>, who <a href=#>starred with her</a> in the 2003 comedy Just Married. She was engaged twice, first to producer <strong>Jeff Kwatinetz</strong>&nbsp;for nearly five months in 2004 and again the following year, to <strong>Joe Macaluso</strong>, a production assistant on her 2004 film Little Black Book. The pair ended their romance in August 2006, shortly before she took up with Monjack.</p><p>While many seemed confused by the pairing, Murphy told <a href=#>OK Magazine</a> in April 2009, eight months before she died, that “the easiest decision I ever made in my life was getting married.”</p><p>However, in the HBO Max doc, <a href=#>those close to the Girl, Interrupted actress</a> describe Monjack as a sinister presence in her life. <strong>Alex Merkin</strong>, who directed Murphy’s 2009 film Across the Hall recalls seeing red flags in the Two Days, Nine Lives director. Merkin claimed he exhibited “Jekyll and Hyde behavior” and <a href=#>often seemed “out of it.”</a></p><p>The man at the helm of one of <a href=#>Murphy’s final films</a> remembered the Georgia native coming to set and “be[ing] in a really good place, and then I would see her go off with Simon.” When she would come back, Merkin said he “felt a stark change in her mood.”</p><p>Following her death, many including <a href=#>Murphy’s father, <strong>Angelo Bertolotti</strong></a>, <a href=#>accused Monjack</a> of having a hand in her demise — something the <a href=#>Factory Girl producer vehemently denied</a> months before his own May 2010 death.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Our marriage was dogged by these ridiculous rumors. Brittany’s life was dogged by ridiculous rumors, and the truth always wins out,” he told <a href=#>Us Weekly</a> in February 2010. “I hope people have the sense to really understand that everything was beautiful and wonderful in our relationship and so pure.”</p><p>Keep scrolling to learn more about this <a href=#>tragic Hollywood romance</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkr7O1062Yp7FdosKzvMeyZJqmlGK1tr%2FBmqWdZaOeurC6jKamp6KRmLi0edGeo5qsmaS7tLTIqWStoZ2auaq6xGg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./vinny-curry.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Fame | Vinny Curry net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./trippie-redds-girlfriend-list.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Trippie Redd Dating Trippie Redd's Girlfriend &amp;amp; Exes</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-offensive-t-shirts-that-have-been-removed-from-stores.html>15 Most Offensive T-Shirts Ever</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./extreme-makeover-jillian-harris-edition.html>Extreme Makeover: Jillian Harris Edition!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lizzy-mcalpine-tour-2022-how-buy-tickets.html>Lizzy McAlpine tour 2022: How can I buy tickets?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nichole-lynel.html>Nichole Lynel</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./teddy-afro.html>Teddy Afro</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 LoopBlog.
