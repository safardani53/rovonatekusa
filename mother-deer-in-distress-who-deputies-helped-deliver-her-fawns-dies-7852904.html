Dawson also noted that the animal was lying out in the Kentucky heat for two days trying to give birth.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"She never stood up as long as I had her," Dawson tells PEOPLE.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She also shared information regarding the status of the two fawns in her Facebook post.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Her twins are a girl and boy,” the post reads. “I have named them Jack and Jill. They are very small and fawns are very fragile.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Fawns are normally born late May or early June,” the post added, emphasizing their fragile state being born so late in the season. “No one has fawn this size so they need each other.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I am praying they both make it,” the post concludes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In subsequent updates on Facebook, Dawson shared that she was able to secure goat milk to feed the newborns. She tells PEOPLE that "one is thriving." She says the other is still not eating a lot, but that she "still has hope."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Warren County Sheriff’s Office<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1> detailed their rescue efforts</a> in <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>a Facebook post</a> on Tuesday.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After the dramatic delivery, the mother deer was checked over and given water via a syringe to keep her hydrated. The fawn siblings were fed bottles of milk.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The trio was later taken to Wild 4 Life. The Warren County Sheriff's Office shared that they provided the mother doe some medical treatment, and, at the time, she was showing signs of improvement.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In a similar story of first responders coming to the rescue with a more heartwarming ending, in June, firefighters in Owing Mills, Maryland, came to the aid of a female deer whose <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>baby got stuck in a storm drain</a> for hours. According to local news station <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>WBAL-TV</a>, a mother and son encountered the animal walking around and looking in the drain, in evident distress.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Never miss a story — sign up for <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>PEOPLE's free daily newsletter</a> to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When firefighters responded, they used metal tools to pry open the drain. Then, a rescuer climbed into the drain and emerged a few minutes later, holding a tiny fawn in his arms. The man took the baby animal over to its mother, who had been watching the proceedings from a nearby patch of grass.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The baby deer starts to cry, and our hearts begin to melt and not a second later, he just comes out of the drain holding this sweet baby deer that looks like it could be just merely days old," Kim Brandwin, who captured a video of the rescue, told the news outlet.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It was, at first, heart-wrenching, and I was definitely holding back all of my tears," Brandwin added. "Then, when I actually realized I was videoing something actually spectacular, it felt heartwarming."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ52kwamx0Wabnp2iYravecOiqq2qlajAbsPHqGSdnaCqwaqx0mafnqSgmrFusMSloK%2BdomK1pr6Mn5iwpqNisaqx0mZucW1ibn11</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./too-close-fans-shocked-quickie-sex-kitchen-counter.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Too Close fans shocked at Dr Emma Robertson's 'awkward' quickie sex on the kitchen counter</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./miley-cyrus-covers-lana-del-reys-summertime-sadness-on-bbc-radio-20131211.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Miley Cyrus Sings Summertime Sadness: Lana Del Rey Song Covered On BBC</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-offensive-t-shirts-that-have-been-removed-from-stores.html>15 Most Offensive T-Shirts Ever</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./extreme-makeover-jillian-harris-edition.html>Extreme Makeover: Jillian Harris Edition!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lizzy-mcalpine-tour-2022-how-buy-tickets.html>Lizzy McAlpine tour 2022: How can I buy tickets?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nichole-lynel.html>Nichole Lynel</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./teddy-afro.html>Teddy Afro</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 LoopBlog.
