It's also more compact than other steering wheel locks, making it easier to store when not in use.</p><p>This double hook steering lock doesn’t get along with Peugeot’s new multi-compact steering wheel (it's a little too small for the fit) but other vehicles can make swift use of this reasonably priced device.</p><p><strong>READ MORE:</strong></p><h2>2. Stoplock Pro</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Stoplock-Pro.jpg><ul><li><strong>Stoplock Pro, £45.00 from Amazon - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">buy now</a></strong></li></ul><p>All-round industry champion, Stoplock is a name synonymous with car security since the days before electronic systems were even a thing.</p><p>This Hi-Vis lock offers a visual deterrent and feeds through your steering wheel easily, locks and removes just as quickly.</p><p>Its design makes for easy storage in the vehicle and while it isn’t the cheapest in this list, it's an award-winning product that can only be defeated with noisy machines.</p><p>Thieves know better and just won’t bother cars with a Stoplock Pro fitted.</p><h2>3. Disklok</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Disklok-Steering-Lock.jpg><ul><li><strong>Disklok, £130.00 from Halfords - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">buy now</a></strong></li></ul><p>Disklok is Stoplock’s main rival and its products are equally tough to remove.</p><p>With a steering wheel cover design and anti-drill and anti-pick technology, the Disklok holds police-preferred accreditation.</p><p>It can be a bit fiddly to set up initially, but once you’re familiar with the locking mechanism, it’s fairly straightforward.</p><p>The Dislok will suit more compact steering wheels, which struggle to accommodate other styles of steering wheel lock, since there are various sizes available - be sure to purchase the right size for your car.</p><p>Though pricey, some insurers do offer a discount if you let them know your car is protected by Disklok.</p><h2>4. Carpoint Steering Wheel Lock Elephant</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Carpoint-Steering-Wheel-Lock-Elephant-e1561984564292.jpg><ul><li><strong>Carpoint Steering Wheel Lock Elephant, £24.08 from Amazon - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">buy now</a></strong></li></ul><p>The Carpoint “Elephant” steering wheel lock is easy-to-fit, since it’s just a "pull to expand" installation into the gap of your steering wheel.</p><p>Fans of the Elephant like it for its versatility, but it isn’t suited to cars with larger steering wheels (i.e. bigger than 36cm diameter), as it can’t expand enough to make the device more than a deterrent.</p><p>Just shy of £18, it’s not going to break the bank either.</p><p>The soft plastic coating prevents any damage or scratches to the steering wheel and the red colour is highly visible, even in the dark.</p><h2>5. Streetwize Urban X Steering Wheel Lock</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Streetwize-Urban-X-Steering-Wheel-Lock.jpg><ul><li><strong>Streetwize Urban X Steering Wheel Lock, £39.00 from Halfords - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">buy now</a></strong></li></ul><p>This more affordable Urban X steering wheel lock from Streetwize is unmissable. The bright yellow disc covers the steering wheel.</p><p>Though Streetwize claims this offers a higher level of security, we'd put it behind the Disklok - no doubt reflected in the cheaper price.</p><p>What’s more, it’s not suitable for new Peugeot drivers.</p><p>That said, if you’re on a budget, you'll have peace of mind at a more reasonable price.</p><h2>6.

Stoplock Van Lock</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Stoplock-Van-Lock-HG199.jpg><ul><li><strong>Stoplock Van Lock, £29.99 from Halfords - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">buy now</a></strong></li></ul><p>Van drivers are more likely to be targeted for the contents of their vehicles, rather than the vehicles themselves.</p><p>This easy-to-use lock can fit rear or side doors and comes with a tamper-proof mechanism.</p><p>A chrome-plated hardened steel padlock with three keys ensures your tools are going nowhere fast and this affordable Stoplock Van Pro can also be used on sheds.

Even if a thief manages to get into your car and start the engine, a good quality lock will prevent them from being able to steer, making it impossible to drive anywhere far.</p><p>That said, steering locks are not impossible to break. If a thief really wants your vehicle, they'll normally find a way.</p><p>But as steering locks are usually made from hardened alloy, they'd require an angle grinder, drill or heavy-duty hack saw to break, which would be loud and draw attention. Two things no thief wants.</p><p>So while steering locks aren't impenetrable, they ensure your car isn't an easy target. This more times than not means any potential thief would be put off. In short, if you want maximum protection for your motor, a steering lock is only going to help.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MORE FROM MOTORING</h2></p><p><span>We’re all about helping you find the best products at the best prices - at home, for your wardrobe, or for a specific occasion.
