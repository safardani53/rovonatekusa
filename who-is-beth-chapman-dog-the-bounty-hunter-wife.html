While this news is utterly heartbreaking, she remains strong – and she’s even “<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>excited</a>” to get back to work on Dog’s new show, Dog’s Most Wanted. Beth has said that this new cancer fight is just another chapter in her life and not the end of the story – but what is the story behind Dog’s better half?</p><p id=content-paragraph-3><strong>1. She met Dog when she was just a teenager.</strong> Beth (born Alice Elizabeth Smith) first met Duane when in 1988, according to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Country Living</a>, when she was 19 years old (and he was 35.) She was working for a lawmaker at the time and was in a grocery store when she took a call from her boss. She walked out the store holding a lemon, and was arrested for “shoplifting.” However, she also had an unregistered and unlicensed gun in her pocket (which she had taken from her then-boyfriend after he got drunk.) On top of that, she had an arrest warrant out for unpaid parking tickets.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Beth’s father called in a favor to bail her out of jail, but she refused to go to Dog’s office to do paperwork – until he threatened to put her back behind bars. When she showed up, she automatically fell in love. “He came walking out there, and I said, ‘Oh yes, he will be mine.’ Let the stalking begin,” she told <strong>Rosie O’Donnell </strong>during her OWN show in 2011.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5><strong>2. She broke records to win Dog’s heart</strong>. Dog was also taken by how gorgeous Beth looked when the first met. “I was never one of those older guys who went for the young girls. But damn….I know what you’re thinking. I’m an idiot, right?” he wrote in his memoir, You Can Run, But You Can’t Hide. But, he tried to avoid her since he was married at the time.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Beth would not be deterred. At age 29, she took the test to get a bail license in order to get Dog’s attention, and thus, she became the youngest person ever to get a bail license in Colorado until her stepdaughter, <strong>Lyssa</strong> beat her record. Beth, according to Dog, would take risky cases so she’d have an excuse to call Dog to track down those who skipped bail. He, in turn, would recruit her for bounties if he needed “a brain or a beautiful young girl to act as a decoy.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7><strong>3. She was married before Dog</strong>… Prior to marrying Dog, Beth walked down the aisle with <strong>Keith A. Barmore</strong>. The two divorced, but not before they welcomed a daughter, <strong>Cecily</strong>, 25 into the world in 1993. She has three more children: son <strong>Dominic Smith, </strong>33, with an ex-boyfriend; and two with Dog – <strong>Garry Chapman</strong>, 18, and daughter <strong>Bonnie Joe</strong>, 20,</p><p id=content-paragraph-8><strong>4. … and he’s Dog’s fifth wife. </strong>So, fifth time’s the charm? Dog has been down the aisle an impressive five times. He married <strong>La Fonda Sue Honeycutt</strong> in 1972 (divorced 1977), married <strong>Anne M. Tegnell</strong> in 1979 (divorced in 1982), married <strong>Lyssa Rae Brittain</strong> in 1982 (divorced in 1991), married <strong>Tawny Marie</strong> in 1992 (filed for divorced in 1994), made it official in 2002). Even though he’s known Beth for more than three decades, the two didn’t get married until 2006, 16 years after they started dating.)</p><p id=content-paragraph-9><strong>5. Dog credits her for saving his life</strong>. By 1995, Dog was abusing substances as a way to cope with his personal problems. Eventually, Dog moved back to Denver to live near his sister. “One day, we were both standing in the alley behind the houses on bail bonds row. It was like a scene from a movie,” he wrote in his memoir. “I looked at her and she at me. By the time Beth got to the back of the alley, I was already by her side. I grabbed her and put the most passionate kiss on her.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>Shortly afterward, he and his kids moved into Beth’s house, but he was still abusing drugs. She wasn’t going to let that stand. By 1997, he had kicked the habit, thanks to Beth. “If Beth hadn’t saved me, I’m not sure I would have survived those years.” Now, it’s time for Dog to help Beth get better as she battles cancer for a second time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlpZH1ye5BvZrCgn2K2tHnBnquhZZOdrrG5wKdknaeXYsGpsYybpq6mpK56qcHNrZyrZaees6Z7</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./nelson-thomas-car-accident-saw-him-pulled-out-of-a-burning-vehicle.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Nelson Thomas car accident saw him pulled out of a burning vehicle Wed 15 March 2023 12:39</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./nikita-golubev-dirty-trucks-art.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>These Dirty Cars Are Being Turned Into Masterpieces By A Local Artist</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-offensive-t-shirts-that-have-been-removed-from-stores.html>15 Most Offensive T-Shirts Ever</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./extreme-makeover-jillian-harris-edition.html>Extreme Makeover: Jillian Harris Edition!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lizzy-mcalpine-tour-2022-how-buy-tickets.html>Lizzy McAlpine tour 2022: How can I buy tickets?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nichole-lynel.html>Nichole Lynel</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./teddy-afro.html>Teddy Afro</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 LoopBlog.
