Both were dressed casually in t-shirts and sunglasses as they enjoyed their meal seated side by side.</p><p>Us Weekly confirmed that <a href=#>the pair are dating</a> in May, one week after the comedian confirmed to Us he had <a href=#>split from his wife of six years</a>, <a href=#><strong>Anna Marie Tendler</strong></a>.</p><p>“John will not have any further comment as he continues to focus on his recovery and getting back to work,” his spokesperson noted at the time.</p><p>The artist, 36, offered her own statement as well.</p><p>“I am heartbroken that John has decided to end our marriage,” Tendler said. “I wish him support and success as he continues his recovery.”</p><p>Last December, the Big Mouth voice actor made headlines when he <a href=#>checked himself into rehab</a> for alcoholism and cocaine addiction. At the time, a source told Us that <a href=#>the move was a “relief” to those close to Mulaney</a>.</p><p>“John has always been engaged in his sobriety. The relapse got ugly, but it was his choice to go to rehab, which saved his life,” the insider explained.</p><p>At the time, Munn wished him well via Twitter.</p><p>“Sending SO MUCH love and support to John Mulaney. You got this,” the Newsroom alum wrote.</p><p>The Oklahoma native has <a href=#>publicly shared her adoration</a> for the<a href=#> Saturday Night Live</a> alum before.</p><p>“We were at a wedding together and I was like, ‘Oh, my gosh, do you and your [Tendler] want to go have dinner or something and go hang out?’” Munn recalled during a 2015 conversation with HuffPost Live. “At first it was cool, and then I kept going up to him at the wedding like, ‘So, you having fun?’ I was just so obsessed with hanging out with and talking with him.”</p><p>The Buddy Games actress then attempted to get a hold of her now-beau via email — but he never responded.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I might’ve got the wrong email — probably,” she said at the time. “That’s what I tell myself.”</p><p>Prior to her relationship with the Chicago native, Munn was linked to <strong>Tucker Roberts</strong>. The duo <a href=#>broke up amicably at the end of 2019</a>, a separate source told Us in August 2020.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkt7C0zWakrqSRo7K6ecCnm2annJ7Dqq2Mpqynpl2au6u72GajrqaTnXqlrdOeZKKmXaG8tHnAp56epJWofA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./khloe-kardashian-true-dream-fierce-photo-shoot.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Khlo Kardashian's Daughter True, Niece Dream Strike a Pose: Photos</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jackie-walorski-passed-away-at-the-age-of-58-in-a-car-accident.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jackie Walorski Passed Away At The Age Of 58 In A Car Accident</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-offensive-t-shirts-that-have-been-removed-from-stores.html>15 Most Offensive T-Shirts Ever</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./extreme-makeover-jillian-harris-edition.html>Extreme Makeover: Jillian Harris Edition!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lizzy-mcalpine-tour-2022-how-buy-tickets.html>Lizzy McAlpine tour 2022: How can I buy tickets?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nichole-lynel.html>Nichole Lynel</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./teddy-afro.html>Teddy Afro</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 LoopBlog.
