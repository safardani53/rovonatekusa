I love coming to work every day,” the athlete told <a href=#>ESPN</a> in December 2012. “But also, being at home, and giving those boys my attention, and my affection, and my discipline, and being a good parent is so important, because I grew up with two of the <a href=#>best parents a son could ever ask for</a>.”</p><p>Brady cemented himself as the GOAT of the NFL after <a href=#>playing for the New England Patriots for 20 years</a>. He won six <a href=#>Super Bowls</a> as the quarterback of the Massachusetts-based team before he joined the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2020.</p><p>The <a href=#>199 Productions owner</a> went on to win Super Bowl LV with the Bucs in February 2021, and fans began to wonder whether he <a href=#>would take a step back from the sport</a> to be with his kids.</p><p>“Beyond [next year’s season], I don’t know,” Brady told the Wall Street Journal Magazine in September 2021 of his future in the NFL. “Maybe it’s another year after that; maybe it’s two. I’ll have to see where I’m at with my family. That’s probably the overriding factor — what I’m missing out on.”</p><p>Brady briefly retired in February 2022 but changed his plan weeks later. Through all of his career highs and lows, his now ex-wife, <a href=#><strong>Gisele Bündchen</strong></a>, and <a href=#>his three kids have been Brady’s biggest fans</a>.</p><p>The TB12 cofounder shares <a href=#>Benjamin and Vivian</a>, born in December 2009 and December 2012, respectively, with the supermodel, whom he wed in February 2009. Brady is also the father of <a href=#>son Jack</a>, whom he welcomed with ex-girlfriend <a href=#><strong>Bridget Moynahan</strong></a> in August 2007.</p><p>Us Weekly confirmed in September 2022 that <a href=#>Brady’s brief retirement put pressure on his marriage</a> to the Brazil native. One month later, the pair announced they <a href=#>had finalized their divorce</a> and were no longer together.</p><p>In February 2023, the 80 for Brady producer <a href=#>announced he was retiring from the NFL “for good”</a> and made sure to thank his family for their support over the past 23 seasons. In his retirement announcement, Brady shared multiple <a href=#>photos with his children on the field</a> over the years via Instagram.</p><p>Ahead of his step back, Brady <a href=#>reflected on his own upbringing</a> in August 2019 while speaking about his sons in an interview with <a href=#>Men’s Health</a>, noting that Jack “loves” sports, while Ben has different passions.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“[Jack] wants to try hard, and <a href=#>he never wants to disappoint his dad</a>,” the quarterback told the magazine at the time. “That was me. I’d wake up early on the weekends to do stuff with my dad. That’s why I didn’t party a lot. If Dad wanted to golf, I wanted to be there with him. And if I ever missed those things, it would crush me.”</p><p>Scroll down for some of Brady’s most heartfelt parenting quotes:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8sbXCrayrnaNkwbC5jJupmpypqHqjsdKtZKqtn6mytHnAm6aurF2brrW0xKufqKeUYr%2BitdKipaBlmJ7Abn%2BMpKCdq18%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-lasercorn-dating.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Lasercorn Dating Now</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./caro-love-island-usa.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Grab Your Passport!
