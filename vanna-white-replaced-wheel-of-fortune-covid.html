The episodes were part of “Teacher’s Week,” and are expected to air in October. During her absence, Vanna was replaced by&nbsp;<strong>Bridgette Donald-Blue</strong>, who was the recipient of Teacher of the Year. This is just the fourth time in Vanna’s tenure that she’s been absent from&nbsp;Wheel. In 1986, she took time off following the death of her boyfriend and in 1991 she spent two weeks away for her honeymoon, as well as home sick with a cold. <span class=s1>HollywoodLife has been able to confirm through an independent source that Vanna did in fact miss a day of taping while they filmed ‘Teachers Week’ and that </span><span class=s2>Bridgette graciously agreed fill in for Vanna for the five episodes that were shot.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Although Vanna only missed a few days of filming, the timing comes amidst <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>negotiations</a> for her contract. Earlier this year,&nbsp;<strong>Pat Sajak</strong> announced that he’d be <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>leaving the show</a> in 2024 when his contract with Sony Pictures Television is up. Vanna’s contract ends at the end of the same season, and she is reportedly in the midst of negotiating with Sony for a bigger payday.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/vanna-white-wheel-of-forrtune-contract-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>In July, Vanna reportedly reached a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>partial deal</a> with the company, but only involving&nbsp;Celebrity Wheel of Fortune, according to&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TMZ</a>. The site reports that she will now make $100,000 per episode for Celebrity Wheel. However, Vanna is reportedly asking for half of Pat’s salary for the syndicated&nbsp;Wheel show, as well, which is where the negotiations continue. Her salary has been the same for the past 18 years.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/vanna-white-wheel-of-forrtune-contract-embed2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>While Vanna’s future with the show still remains uncertain, Pat will <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>be replaced</a> by&nbsp;<strong>Ryan Seacrest</strong> for the 2024/2025 season. After Pat announced his departure in June, Vanna <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>opened up</a> about how much she’ll miss him on set. “When we started&nbsp;Wheel Of Fortune who could have imagined we’d still be at it 41 years later?” Vanna <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>tweeted</a>. “I couldn’t have been happier to have shared the stage with you for all these years with one more to come. Cheers to you, Pat Sajak.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>At the end of June, Pat sent a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>welcome message</a> to Ryan, where he looked ahead to passing the baton. “I’m looking forward to my final season an then handing the car keys over to Ryan in September 2024,” he wrote on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Twitter</a>. The 41st season of&nbsp;Wheel premieres on Sept. 11.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH15e5BqZq%2BZnqOubsPHoqueZaKava2twp6bZq%2BYmrKtec6fZJ%2BnoqnCr7GMnKavoZRk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./wwiis-most-daring-raids.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>WWII's Most Daring Raids - Smithsonian Channel</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./rihanna-and-asap-rocky-share-first-photos-of-baby-son-riot-rose-7971586.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Rihanna and A$AP Rocky Share First Photos of Baby Son Riot Rose</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-offensive-t-shirts-that-have-been-removed-from-stores.html>15 Most Offensive T-Shirts Ever</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./extreme-makeover-jillian-harris-edition.html>Extreme Makeover: Jillian Harris Edition!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lizzy-mcalpine-tour-2022-how-buy-tickets.html>Lizzy McAlpine tour 2022: How can I buy tickets?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nichole-lynel.html>Nichole Lynel</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./teddy-afro.html>Teddy Afro</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 LoopBlog.
