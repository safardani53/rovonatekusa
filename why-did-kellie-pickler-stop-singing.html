Kellie last released an album in 2013, titled "The Woman I Am." In the years that followed, Kellie has performed her music live on occasion, but hasn't released a project in roughly a decade. So, why did she stop putting out new music?</p><p>Well, Kellie has never really directly addressed why the music slowed up over the last 10 years. In the time since that album came out, she has expanded her interests into television, film, live theater, and other creative pursuits. Although there is no definitive answer on when or if Kellie will deliver new tunes to fans, she did speak about the possibility back in 2020.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>"My husband Kyle [Jacobs] and I have been writing.

As previously mentioned, her husband died in February 2023. Within a few weeks of that tragic situation, it was announced that Kellie would be departing from her role as the midday on-air personality at SiriusXM's The Highway. She did not make a statement about her departure and has been quiet on social media since Kyle died.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecOim2ajlaG5qrGMqaCco5yav26%2F06inZquZo7SqusY%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./j-frank-harrison-iii.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Fame | J.
