However, her reality was not all that different. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>In an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview</a> with Untitled magazine, the actress recalled&nbsp;how she was lonely and struggling to make friends in Los Angeles. She was ready to call it quits when her mom and friend sat down with her and encouraged her to stay. Three weeks later, she booked Gossip Girl.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>Born in Wisconsin with Four&nbsp;other siblings.</h2><p>Jessica Karen Szohr was born to her parents in Menomonee Falls,&nbsp;Wisconsin,&nbsp;in 1985. She&nbsp;was the oldest of five&nbsp;children. According to her&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">IMDb</a>&nbsp;bio, the actress is of Black and Hungarian ethnicity.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>At just ten years, she was booked for a national ad campaign&nbsp;for Quaker Oats and&nbsp;featured in ads for Crate & Barrel, Mountain Dew, Sears, Jockey, and JanSport.</p><h2>Being at the right place at the right time</h2><p>Szohr initially wanted to become an interior designer, but her agent convinced her to try out for an audition. That's when she&nbsp;made her debut as an actress in 2003 in an episode of My Wife and Kids. After that, she appeared in numerous shows and movies before she landed her major recurring role of&nbsp;Laura in the ABC drama series What About Brian.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>However, it was a Labor Day barbeque with friends that changed Jessica’s life forever. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>I remember hanging out by the pool in an old T-shirt and jean shorts, just talking to people. Three days later, my manager calls to tell me that I'd been with the show's executive producer and one of the creators wanted me to audition.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p></p><p><strong>Photo of Gossip Girl cast.&nbsp;</strong>(Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Elle)</a></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>A few days later, Jessica was on her way to New York. She was initially booked for only three episodes, but due to her character's popularity, she became a series regular. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>The hit drama series ran for six&nbsp;successful seasons and&nbsp;catapulted Szohr into stardom, eventually landing her a role in The Internship,&nbsp; a Shawn Levy directed Fox comedy starring Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn. She was cast as a stripper. To prepare for her role, Szohr even took pole dancing classes.</p><p>During my first scene, I was walking around in my bra and underwear in front of hundreds of people," Szohr said in an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Younghollywood</a> interview. "I had to bring my A-game. So, two weeks beforehand, I took a pole-dancing lesson. It's an insane work-out! I give strippers a whole lot of credit.</p><p>Nowadays, Szohr&nbsp;is busy being a mother to an infant girl, Bowie Ella Richardson. On Jan 13, the 35-year-old actress <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">announced</a> her&nbsp;darling baby girl's birth on Instagram by sharing a black-and-white&nbsp;picture of Bowie's&nbsp;cute little fingers.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>She captioned it as "Added a little special sweetness to our family and some new directions to our journey on 1-11-21." Highlighting&nbsp;her experience of carrying a child, she added,&nbsp;"To then create a human that is absolutely perfect in our eyes and put a feeling in my heart I didn't know existed is beyond words. I have all the feels, and she is really something special." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>We have nothing but love for the new mommy and daughter duo.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5%2BytL%2FInJhmq6qktbN5z5qpnqakqHqmwMenoJyhpK57qcDMpQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./mkxyeohhqpinqei-me-kio70mqpeclxu.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Stream Movies, Shows &amp;amp; Live TV</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./hulk-hogan-spotted-out-with-new-fiancee-sky-daily-after-announcing-engagement-see-the-ring-7566512.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Hulk Hogan Spotted with Fiance Sky Daily After Engagement: See the Ring</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-offensive-t-shirts-that-have-been-removed-from-stores.html>15 Most Offensive T-Shirts Ever</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./extreme-makeover-jillian-harris-edition.html>Extreme Makeover: Jillian Harris Edition!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lizzy-mcalpine-tour-2022-how-buy-tickets.html>Lizzy McAlpine tour 2022: How can I buy tickets?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nichole-lynel.html>Nichole Lynel</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./teddy-afro.html>Teddy Afro</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 LoopBlog.
