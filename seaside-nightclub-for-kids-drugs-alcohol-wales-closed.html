The reasons why are unknown to all but the children in question.</p><p>"However we can categorically state that they were not served anything alcoholic whilst on our premises."</p><p>But, the club's owner Emma Priestley said she felt let down by the manager.</p><p>The mum-of-four said: "I can't apologise enough. Nothing like this would ever happen again."</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>'SHUT IT DOWN'</h3><p>Nevertheless, Sonny's continues to spark outrage in the local community as residents say it attracts <a href=#>anti-social behaviour.</a></p><p>In total, cops recorded 16 fights, threats of and use of weapons, drunkenness, and theft in their report.</p><p>Nearby businesses have made multiple complaints to the force about the negative impact the bar has on them.</p><p>But, the primary concern is keeping children in the town safe, as locals say it is "rife with drugs".</p><p>Retired couple, David and Elizabeth Corns, moved to Towyn five years ago and say the town becomes a “nightmare” over the summer months.</p><p>Elizabeth, 75, said: “I think they should be shut down because its not good for the area, especially if people are coming here on holiday with their families.</p><p>"You can hear the music booming out even when we’re inside our bungalow and people shouting in the street.</p><p>“And it seems to get worse here every year for <a href=#>drugs</a>.</p><p>“Drugs are rife and I’ve seen teenagers blatantly smoking <a href=#>cannabis </a>in alleyways.”</p><p>Retired cop David, 74, who believes “county lines gangs from <a href=#>Liverpool </a>and <a href=#>Manchester</a>” have targeted the resort, said he’d tried to highlight issues with the local force but “they weren’t interested”.</p><p>“I told them about one drug dealer who was using a scooter,” he said.</p><p>“But it was never investigated.”</p><p>Meanwhile, another fed-up local Doreen Franklin, 72, said: “It’s worrying kids have been getting drunk and causing trouble.</p><p>“I’ve lived here for 34 years and when I first moved here we never had those kids of problems.</p><p>“It was a much friendlier place to live.”</p><p>One mum, who has two daughters, 11 and 12, said she’d seen two fights involving teenagers - one outside her own home and another close to Sunny’s.</p><p>She said: “I know they have kids’ parties at Sunny’s.</p><p>“But I wouldn’t let my two daughters go there, I’d be too worried.</p><p>“I know times have changed since I was a youngster but you shouldn’t be encouraging under-age drinking.”</p><p>And, fellow resident Stacey Bagley called for the venue to be closed after she heard two girls boasting about taking drugs at a party there.</p><p>The 37-year-old said: “I went into a shop with my nephew and there were two girls trying to buy alcohol.</p><p>“They got asked for ID and it turned out they were only aged 12 and 14 so they got an 18-year-old lad to buy for them instead.</p><p>“They were also talking about how they’d smoked weed [cannabis] and taken cocaine at a party, which is shocking.</p><p>“So, absolutely, I hope the police do close it down.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>SUNNY'S SUPPORT</h3><p>Although the bar has been wreaking havoc on the area, according to several residents, there are some who support Sunny's.</p><p>Joe McDonagh, 67, said: "It's terrible that children have been carrying on like.</p><p>"The place does need cleaning up but it will be a shame if the place closes all together.</p><p>"Holidaymakers and locals also enjoy the bar all the time and don't misbehave."</p><p>Meanwhile mum-of-two Sharon Jones, 42, added: "It's a ghost town out of season.</p><p>"There's not much to do and most of the shops shut down.</p><p>"I wouldn't like to see Sunny's and Bentley's shut for good even though it's been a bit of a nightmare."</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>LOST LICENCE</h3><p>Following the controversy surrounding the pub and "kids' club" upstairs, the council made their long-awaited decision regarding Sunny's future.</p><p>While the venue has not been closed down, it has had its alcohol licence stripped away for three months.</p><p>A spokesperson for Conwy Council said:&nbsp;"Following a review by Conwy Council Licensing Authority, Sub Committee on the 8th&nbsp;of December, the premises licence is to be suspended for a period of 3 months.</p><p>"The Designated Premises Supervisor has been removed.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>"Significant conditions have been added to protect children from harm.</p><p>"All the above are subject to appeal."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/bentleys-nightclub-face-losing-licence-866054441.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/bentleys-nightclub-face-losing-licence-866054409.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/bentleys-nightclub-face-losing-licence-866054448.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZ4JxgpNxbW5no5qutLXDnmSnoZedwaS41Jtkn6eiYriqsNJmm6utl6h6orjCqJ%2BopF2srq2x0maapaejmrFw</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./angela-goethals.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Angela Goethals Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./what-happened-to-opies-mom-andy-griffith-show.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>What Happened to Opies Mom on The Andy Griffith Show?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-offensive-t-shirts-that-have-been-removed-from-stores.html>15 Most Offensive T-Shirts Ever</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./extreme-makeover-jillian-harris-edition.html>Extreme Makeover: Jillian Harris Edition!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lizzy-mcalpine-tour-2022-how-buy-tickets.html>Lizzy McAlpine tour 2022: How can I buy tickets?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nichole-lynel.html>Nichole Lynel</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./teddy-afro.html>Teddy Afro</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 LoopBlog.
