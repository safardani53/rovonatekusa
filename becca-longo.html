Having said all of this, well, that old generation is gone, when society used to set a boundary for both the genders.</p><p>In like manner, today, we will talk about<strong> Becca Longo,</strong> an American football kicker who has broken the record after being the first woman to yield a college football scholarship.</p><p>She will be ventured to an NCAA school at the Division II level or higher.

She was powerful, accurate, and intact with her kicking skills.</p><p>We will surely try to post all the facts and figures that would best describe her present life, early life, high school career, social media presence, any hook-ups or rumors about her.</p><p>But before that, let’s catch a sneak peek into the must-known quick facts about the energetic kicker, Becca Longo.</p><h2>Quick Facts:</h2><table><tbody readability=4.8996235884567><tr><td><b>Full Name</b></td><td>Rebecca Longo</td></tr><tr><td><b>Birth Date</b></td><td>March 17, 1999</td></tr><tr><td><b>Birth Place</b></td><td>Chandler, Arizona, US</td></tr><tr><td><b>Nick Name</b></td><td>Longo</td></tr><tr><td><b>Religion</b></td><td>Not known</td></tr><tr><td><b>Nationality</b></td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td><b>Ethnicity</b></td><td>White</td></tr><tr readability=3><td><b>Education</b></td><td>Basha High School, Adams State University</td></tr><tr><td><b>Horoscope</b></td><td>Pisces</td></tr><tr><td><b>Father’s name</b></td><td>Bob Longo</td></tr><tr><td><b>Mother’s name</b></td><td>Andrea</td></tr><tr><td><b>Siblings</b></td><td>Bobby Longo</td></tr><tr><td><b>Age</b></td><td>24 years old</td></tr><tr><td><b>Height</b></td><td>5 feet 9 inches (1.8m)</td></tr><tr><td><b>Weight</b></td><td>140 lb (64kg)</td></tr><tr readability=3><td><strong>Teams played for</strong></td><td>Adams State Grizzlies, Gila River Hawks</td></tr><tr><td><b>Hair Color</b></td><td>Dark Brown</td></tr><tr><td><b>Eye Color</b></td><td>Black</td></tr><tr><td><b>Jersey No.</b></td><td>28</td></tr><tr><td><b>Build</b></td><td>Athlete</td></tr><tr readability=2><td><b>Marital Status</b></td><td>Unmarried ( In a relationship)</td></tr><tr><td><b>Boyfriend</b></td><td>James Ackel</td></tr><tr><td><b>Position</b></td><td>Kicker</td></tr><tr><td><b>Profession</b></td><td>Football player</td></tr><tr><td><b>Net Worth</b></td><td>Not known</td></tr><tr><td><b>Salary</b></td><td>Not known</td></tr><tr><td><b>Currently Plays for</b></td><td>Gila River Hawks</td></tr><tr readability=2><td><b>Recognition</b></td><td>The first woman to earn a college football scholarship</td></tr><tr><td><b>Active Since</b></td><td>2017- present</td></tr><tr><td><b>Social Media</b></td><td><a href=#>Twitter</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>Instagram</a></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Becca Longo | Early Life, Family, and Education</h2><p><strong>Rebecca Longo,</strong> shortly Becca Longo, was born on March 17, 1989, to her parents <strong>Andrea Longo</strong> and <strong>Bob Longo</strong>, in Chandler, Arizona, US.</p><p>As for her siblings,&nbsp; Becca has a brother named Bobby Longo, who is eleven years older than her. Becca belongs to a complete athletic family, and athleticism lies in her blood.</p><p>From the very early days of her life, Becca had this ultimate craze for sports that led her to have the athletic potential she offers now.</p><p>To put it in words, she was already comfortable standing on the water skies at the tender age of four.</p><p>Later, when she turned nine, she just blew everything off while kicking the soccer balls. As much as she remembers, she was a warrior, a tough competitor who never gives up.</p><h3>Following her older brother footsteps, Bobby Longo</h3><p>Becca always remained in awe of her older brother’s play as she both appreciated and competed with him during the plays.</p><p>Her older brother Bobby must have served as a defensive end for their high school football team, but he was a real icon to Becca.</p><p>Becca was always lingered to learn all those tips and techniques which his brother implemented on the field.</p><p>She was bound to mimick to do more than his brother if Bobby notched two jumps on the water skies. She tried to notch three. If Bobby opted to play for high school, she drove to be a collegiate player.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Becca-Longo-4-240x300.jpg><p>If this is not ideally trying to follow her brother’s footsteps, then what is so? But hardcore challenges were waiting in a line.</p><p>She was a girl, and football was a boy’s thing, where girls were expected to only serve as a cheerleader. She had to be really tough to give a tough competition to the athletes.</p><p>With the comments that Becca went through every time to be a girl footballer, she had to refuel herself with positivity every time, which she did adorably.</p><p>She could even hear the sound of the kicker’s foot trying to make links with the ball on the ground. She is fond of all those memories associated with football.</p><p>Moreover, during an interview with Rocky Mountain PBS, Becca shared one more role model in her life from her older brother’s football team. She did not mention her name.</p><p>Still, after seeing that girl play football, she realized only men are not meant for football; even girls can excel.</p><p>She watched that girl play football whole, she was six, and her brother was seventeen at that time.</p><h2>Becca Longo | High School Career</h2><p>Becca was curious to choose her high school and college to help explore her capacity like every other player. She went on attending Basha High School in Chandler, Arizona.</p><p>She played various sports there. After all, she was a true athlete and showed up for football, basketball, and soccer.</p><p>During her sophomore year, Becca jumped off with football in a competitive manner. She also remained a junior varsity kicker at Queen Creek High in Arizona, but she was allegedly benched out for her junior year after switching to Basha High.</p><p>While she plunged into her last year of high school, Becca converted 35 extra points on 38 attempts. She was proved to be an emperor in the field attempting for 30 yards.&nbsp;</p><p>She also had her father’s immense support for all of this when she decided to kick a different ball.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Becca-Longo-2-300x300.jpg><p>Becca always wanted to push the boundaries and break the limits, especially for those who are stereotyped in saying girls are not meant for football.</p><p>Her parents also drove her to Gilbert Christian High school to attend a kicking camp hosted by the Arizona Cardinals.</p><p>And a fact, without any elaborated training, Becca scored first in a sport she had never played.</p><p>When she was on the field, she never felt new with the coach or players, and also, the first time she put on that jersey filled her with joy.</p><p>Hey there, talking about female athletes and football, why not read yet another article on,</p><p><strong><a href=#>&lt;&lt;Jasmine Plummer(1993): The first-ever female quarterback for a Pop Warner football team>></a></strong></p><h2>Becca Longo | College Career</h2><p>Becca and her father compile her early high school play game videos and form a delightful highlight.</p><p>Accidentally, Adams State offensive coordinator Josh Blankenship happen to come across Becca’s homegrown talent as a kicker. She nailed the art of kicking.</p><p>Blankenship was looking for a hardcore kicker and eventually decided to see her on the real ground and headed to Basha.</p><p>After which, a fortunate moment took place in her life; Becca was called for a tryout, and eventually, she impressed everyone with the toughest kick that she gave with her right leg. It was an eye-popping one.</p><p>Not to mention, head coach<strong> Timm Rosenbach</strong>, a former NFL quarterback himself, viewed her vigorous kick and clearly made a statement that,</p><p>“I don’t care if the player’s a Martian…the gender part wasn’t really a factor to me.” to ESPN.</p><p>Indeed, he was a true coach to judge Becca from any norms, culture, stereotype, looks, background, status, gender.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Becca-Longo-with-her-teamamates-e1623484821808-300x293.jpg><p>When Becca joined Adams State University to perform for Adams State Grizzlies, she was redshirted for a year.</p><p>Following that, she faced an untimely ankle injury during the 2018 season and had to leave her scholarship without notching a kick or playing a down in a game.</p><p>Becca also shared this information via her social media handle and aware of her fans that she is not stopping and looking for other better opportunities.</p><p>And suddenly, news popped up about her joining Gila River Hawks, a newly formed 4-team Hohokam Junior College Athletic Conference.</p><p>Becca remained &nbsp;4-for-7 in PATs for the first two games and successfully attempted 22 yards.</p><h2>Becca Longo | Bullying, Tough Days and Transition</h2><p>It was never too smooth for a girl to reach a spot out here and make a name for being the first female athlete to get an NCAA scholarship.</p><p>She had all those criticisms, comments, challenges on their way as she really could not hide who she is, a girl?</p><p>No matter how well she did as a kicker, Becca’s meritocracy could not stop the severe sexism and biases.</p><p>People would post on the infobahn saying, Is she wearing her jersey, or is it her boyfriend’s jersey? And in response to that, Becca would laugh it out loud for an entire season.</p><p>For a society, which is still full of stereotypical people and misogynist men, it seems really hard to digest that Becca was doing exceptionally well as a kicker, kickass on the ground.</p><p>Not even that, her own peers and her mates could not accept the fact; she was actually one of the good players.</p><p>Enough of the traditional boundaries and the common rules, she urged to move to Basha High School after facing mostly at Queen Creek.</p><p>Well, being emotionally and mentally strong was only the way out to hold her defense mechanism.</p><p>Unlike Becca’s high school days, her college days were quite changed. The players would no longer treat her as an outsider. She was warmly welcomed.</p><p>She knew that her high school was a part, and college kicking is something different. Longo had to grow, no matter what.</p><p>Well, thanks to the football scholarship that identified her as the first-ever female on an athletic scholarship.</p><h2>Becca Longo | Stats</h2><table><tbody><tr><td width=104>FG Made</td><td width=104>FG Attempts</td><td width=104>PAT Made</td><td width=104>PAT Attempts</td><td width=104>Total points</td><td width=104>Points Per Game</td></tr><tr><td width=104>1</td><td width=104>1</td><td width=104>30</td><td width=104>33</td><td width=104>33</td><td width=104>4.1</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Becca Longo | Personal Life and Boyfriend</h2><p>It is no doubt that Becca has been proved a sensation for the younger generation to come. She has served as an example to all the wanted-to-be football players out there.</p><p>She has proved, things are not easy and smooth, but there is nothing that you cannot do.</p><p>Many would ponder on Becca’s personal life and her hook-ups and affairs coming to her personal aspects of life.</p><h3>Does Becca Longo have a boyfriend?</h3><p>The answer is probably yes. We tried searching on the whole internet, but not even a single revelation could be cracked out regarding her affairs.</p><p>But yes, scrolling over her Instagram posts, we found something intriguing. In one of her Instagram posts, she has posted a picture with a guy named <strong>James Ackel</strong> captioning,</p><p>“I may be a little biased but I definitely had the most handsome wedding date (and the best dancer too)I love you so much thank you for always taking me on new adventures! Many more to come”.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Becca-Longo-1-300x300.jpg><p>It’s clear enough that she is into someone and prudently serious about her career at the same time.</p><p>Moreover, to bring in a fruitful change, Becca has to urge to take a drastic step and battle against the ultra-misogynist.</p><h2>Becca Longo | Net Worth</h2><p>Playing Divison-II football that too on a scholarship was a myth for the female athletes, but that happened to be true when Becca took the ultimate courage and became the one.</p><p>&nbsp;She throws off a powerful kick, heckles beauty with mightiness. Well, nothing accurate could be extracted about Beccas net worth.</p><p>On the top, she is still a college-level player and has a long way to go.</p><h2>Social Media Presence:</h2><p>Well, Becca is not only a player but an influencer too. She has been seen guiding kids who are really interested in football. She has really set the bar high after getting into football.</p><p>We can follow Becca on her Instagram and Twitter profile, and she seems actively available there with a whopping number of followers.</p><p>All we can do is give this young and brave soul a random follow by clicking on the below-mentioned links.</p><p><a href=#>Twitter</a>: 6,824 followers</p><p><a href=#>Instagram</a>: 34.1k followers</p><p>Just an outlook, after getting to know her, people might feel that Becca all wanted to prove and support feminism.&nbsp;</p><p>Well, just to let you know, there are women in society who are equally anti-women and behave obnoxiously, and then there are these men who equally support women.</p><p>Thus, feminism is not biological, but it is all about having a strong ideology.</p><h2>Some FAQs:</h2><h3>Why did Becca Longo transfer to Basha High School?</h3><p>Becca Longo was facing bullying and criticism while at Queen Creek High School.
