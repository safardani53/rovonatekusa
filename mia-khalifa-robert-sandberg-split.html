href=#>former adult actress Mia Khalifa</a> made an <a href=#>announcement about her relationship with her husband.</a></p><p>She called off her wedding celebration to Robert Sandberg despite the pair trying their "absolute hardest".</p><p>The media personality&nbsp;had previously delayed her June 2020 wedding due to the&nbsp;<a href=#>Covid</a>&nbsp;pandemic, but then canceled the reception for good.</p><p>According to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Republic World</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>Mia&nbsp;</a>and Robert legally got married at their home in 2020 , and had just celebrated their first wedding anniversary.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE ON MIA KHALIFA">READ MORE ON MIA KHALIFA</h2><p>However, they were expected to hold a late celebration for friends and family, which has since been scrapped.</p><p>Mia announced the couple's split in an&nbsp;<a href=#>Instagram</a>&nbsp;post accompanied by a black and white photograph of the couple's shadows.</p><p>She wrote: "We can confidently say we gave it our all in making our marriage work but after almost a year of therapy and efforts we are walking away knowing we have a friend in each other, and that we truly tried.</p><p>"We will always love and respect each other because we know that not one isolated incident caused our split, but rather, a culmination of unresolvable, fundamental differences that no one can blame the other for."</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Celebrity</h2></p><p>She went on to admit that the pair have "no regrets" and that they will remain connected through their "family, friends and our love for our dogs".</p><p>Mia dubbed the split as "long overdue" but reiterated that the pair "can walk away saying we tried our absolute hardest".</p><h2>Has Mia Khalifa been married before?</h2><p>The <a href=#>former Pornhub icon</a> was previously married during her adult career for three years between 2011 and 2014.</p><p>It was reported that she got married straight out of high school at the start of <a href=#>her pornographic career</a>, but her former husband's name has not been identified.</p><p>She then got engaged to Sandberg in March 2019, but he first appeared on her Instagram in August 2018.</p><p>Sandberg, 28, is a chef from&nbsp;<a href=#>Sweden</a>&nbsp;who lived in&nbsp;<a href=#>LA</a>&nbsp;with Khalifa and their dog, Bella.</p><p>It is unclear if he will remain in the States or return to his homeland.</p><img

href=#>Khalifa is worth approximately $4million.</a></p><p>While working in the porn industry for those three months, she stated that she only made $12,000, earning around $1,000 a scene.</p><p>Khalifa became an overnight sensation for filming a threesome while wearing a hijab despite being raised Catholic.</p><p>She was widely criticized for partaking in such a video and received death threats all over the Middle East, including from the Islamic State terrorist group.</p><p>Khalifa quit the industry in 2015 shortly after and relocated to <a href=#>Miami</a>, <a href=#>Florida</a>, where she worked as a paralegal and bookkeeper.&nbsp;</p><h2>Who is Mia Khalifa currently dating?</h2><p>In the summer of 2021, Mia sparked <a href=#>dating rumors with Puerto Rican singer, Jhay Cortez</a>, after the two were seen together in a video that was leaked to <a href=#>YouTube</a>.</p><p>In the leaked video, Mia is lying on Cortez as he attempts to teach her the lyrics to his song, Christian Dior.</p><p>On October 29, 2021, Cortéz – also known as Jhayco – had a concert at the José Miguel Agrelot Coliseum in <a href=#>Puerto Rico</a>.</p><p>During the show, Mia surprised fans by joining the singer on stage and sharing a passionate kiss with him.</p><p>They each reposted video footage of them kissing to both of their Instagram stories.</p><p>On November 5, 2021, Khalifa and Cortéz each took to their <a href=#>social media</a> to confirm their relationship.</p><p>Cortez posted a photo of the two in the car followed by a video of them kissing, and captioned the post:</p><p>"LA PRESION YA NO SOY YO ES ELLA @MIAKHALIFA", which translates to "The pressure is not me, it is her."</p><p>Khalifa also uploaded a photo of the couple, captioning her post: "Te sigo @jhaycortez", which translates to "I follow you."</p><p>Khalifa shared another steamy photo on her Instagram of Cortéz on November 19 as the pair enjoyed a trip in <a href=#>Las Vegas</a>.</p><p>The musician is seen holding Khalifa from behind and flashing his middle finger as he kisses her, with the caption reading: "Aaaaand we missed our flight&nbsp;@jhaycortez."</p><p>On December 29, 2021, Khalifa made light on <a href=#>TikTok</a> of a feud Jhayco and Rauw Alejandro are having.</p><p>Khalifa is pictured in the video using her computer, seemingly looking something up on the Internet with a caption saying: "Me on Google translate tryna keep up with this jhayco beef but it won't accept 'huelebicho' as an adjective."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>However, the couple reportedly split up the following year.</p><p>There were also rumors that she dated <a href=#>NFL</a>
