She was interested in sports and modeling from a young age.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Hoopes aspired to be a gym instructor with a second job as a sports coach. In middle school, Hoopes played field hockey, but not in high school.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>She was warned not to play field hockey since she was a model and would constantly have bruises. Therefore, she gave up the world of sports to be a model. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>And to be a successful one, she received modeling training at Barbizon Chique in Philadelphia. As a result, Hoopes came to Hollywood in 2013 to pursue a modeling career.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>After over six years of modeling for Sports Illustrated, Hoopes is taking a break from her career. This is because she is busy with her children and partner.</p><h2>Blessed With Two Kids</h2><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Hoopes shares two children with Salvatore Palella, an Italian entrepreneur. On August 15, 2021, she took to Instagram to share a picture of herself and her youngest kid wearing matching outfits.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In the captions, she penned how happy she was as a full-time mother. She called having two kids "a blessing and a balancing act."</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Hoopes has employed no nanny because she wants to spend all her time with her children. However, balancing two kids has been challenging&nbsp;for the model.&nbsp;</p><p>This is because both her babies are incredibly young. Her older son, George, was born in August 2020, which makes him two years old. Similarly, her youngest child,&nbsp;Kennedy, is just a week old.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>George was not used to having a baby sister around, so it has been difficult for her to adjust.&nbsp;As&nbsp;a result, Hoopes feels like she is not doing enough for both kids.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Regardless, she is enjoying her life to the fullest because her kids are her biggest blessing. She is doing her best to avoid the "mom guilt" and devote all her time caring for her babies and husband.&nbsp;</p><h2>Samantha Hoopes and&nbsp;Salvatore Palella</h2><p>Palella is a successful entrepreneur with a couple of businesses under his belt. He is the CEO of&nbsp;Helbiz, the&nbsp;first micro-mobility company listed on Nasdaq.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Hoopes got engaged to Palella</a> in July 2018.&nbsp;Hoopes shared the good news with a ring selfie and a slideshow of Palella's passionate proposal on Instagram.&nbsp;</p><p>The entrepreneur&nbsp;chose a romantic approach to his creative engagement proposal. As a result, he surprised Hoopes with the precise number of flowers corresponding to the number of days since they first met.</p><p>Palella proposed in Milan, Italy, at the Bulgaria Hotel after 381 days of meeting the model for the first time at the same spot. He designed a massive diamond engagement ring for his&nbsp;fiancée.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>It is not known if the couple is married or not. Regardless, they refer to each other as husband and wife on their social media.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKuRoq6vwMeaZKGnn6WytHnHrqqbmZ6Zeqy1w6xloaydoQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./dua-lipa-nail-art-for-holiday-2020-pics-details.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Dua Lipa Nail Art for Holiday 2020: Pics, Details</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./steven-avery-on-lynn-hartman-shes-a-gold-digger-were-over.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>She's a Gold Digger!
