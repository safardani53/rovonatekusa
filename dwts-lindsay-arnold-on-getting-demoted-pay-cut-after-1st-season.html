When <a href=#><strong>Lindsay Arnold</strong> </a>joined the professional lineup of&nbsp;<i><a href=#>Dancing With the Stars</a>&nbsp;</i>in March 2013, she thought she hit the career jackpot — until being demoted to a troupe member.</p><p class=p1>“<i>Dancing With the Stars&nbsp;</i>called, and they were like, ‘We want you to do this season,’ so I pushed [college] back again,” the&nbsp;<i><a href=#>So You Think You Can Dance</a>&nbsp;</i>alum, 28, explained during the January 31 episode of <a href=#><strong>Jason Tartick</strong></a>’s <a href=#>“Trading Secrets”</a> podcast. “Then, I think after that first season of&nbsp;<i>Dancing With the Stars</i>, I realized, like, ‘Oh, maybe I don’t need to go to college right now.’ … It just fell into place.”</p><p class=p1>Arnold’s first season aired in March 2013, when she was partnered with boxer <a href=#><strong>Victor Ortiz</strong></a> during season 16. However, she claimed he had a “difficult personality,” which <a href=#>hindered their working relationship</a> and contributed to her “demotion.”</p><p class=p1>“Then, I was <a href=#>given the boot down to troupe</a> for four or five seasons,” she recalled to the&nbsp;<a href=#><i>Bachelorette&nbsp;</i></a>alum, 33. “And then brought [back] up to pro. I wasn’t ready. I just was not ready. Honestly, that was probably one of the hardest parts of my career even though it’s such an incredible job; it’s an amazing job.”</p><p class=p1>While she <a href=#>gushed about her&nbsp;<i>DWTS&nbsp;</i>work</a> now — including her season 25 win with <a href=#><strong>Jordan Fisher</strong> </a>— she admitted that she was initially saddened to be <a href=#>downgraded to a troupe member</a> for those four seasons. (The troupe members do not dance with celebrity partners but rather perform in intro or “bumper” numbers with the other pros.)</p><p class=p1>“In hindsight, I know that I wasn’t quite ready. I needed to find out who I was, first of all,” Arnold said, noting her salary was cut in half. “And, what’s interesting is, when I say to you that it is a different kind of work, but you put in more hours on troupe sometimes than you do as a professional,” Arnold said, alleging <a href=#>the amount she received</a> is not a livable wage. “It’s a total pay cut!”</p><p class=p1>The ballroom dancer further explained her duties as a member of the troupe.</p><p class=p1>“You <a href=#>put in more hours on troupe sometimes</a> than you do as a professional because you are basically on-call 24/7,” she said. “You’re on the show’s schedule, always on call, ready to go. As a backup dancer, back when I did it, yes [the salary was livable], because there were two seasons a year.”</p><p class=p1>She continued: “But, <a href=#>with one season a year</a>, no, I guess it depends on the kind of life that you live, but living in L.A., paying rent, buying food there, paying for gas, like, you’d be really tight.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>The Move With Linds founder —&nbsp;who welcomed daughter <a href=#>Sage</a> in November 2020 with husband <a href=#><strong>Sam Cusick</strong></a> — recently partnered with former Bachelor <a href=#><strong>Matt James</strong></a> during <a href=#>season 30 of&nbsp;<i>DWTS</i></a>, which aired late last year.</p><p class=p1>“To <a href=#>my incredible partner&nbsp;@mattjames919</a>&nbsp;<span class=s1>✨</span>&nbsp;thank you for making this season so memorable, enjoyable, and fun every single day,” the Utah native captioned an&nbsp;Instagram&nbsp;tribute to the ABC Food Tours founder, 28, in October 2021 <a href=#>after their shocking elimination</a>. “You are genuine, kind, funny, hard working, and one of the funnest people to be around. I am SO proud of you!! Coming in to this experience with zero dance or performance background and giving it your all week after week and genuinely improving SO much!!! I could not be more proud to be your coach, partner, and friend.
