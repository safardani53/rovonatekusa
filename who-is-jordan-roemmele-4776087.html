The 46-year-old New Mexico native won a new legion of fans starring in the <strong>Mark Wahlberg</strong>-produced series — but he already had a solid following by starring in 1999’s Drive Me Crazy with <strong>Melissa Joan Hart</strong> and subsequently playing the hunk in the accompanying music video with <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Britney Spears</strong></a>! He then cemented his status as a leading heartthrob when he won the part of <strong>Anne Hathaway’s</strong> boyfriend in the 2006 iconic comedy Devil Wears Prada.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Jordan-Roemmele-5-things-ss-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>Since the end of Entourage in 2011 — with a movie version out in 2015 — Adrian has kept a low profile in the on-screen acting category. He’s been focusing on working behind the camera and giving his time to many philanthropic efforts, including launching a sustainable lifestyle brand called SHFT.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Also in the works was a romance with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Jordan Roemmele</strong></a>, whom Adrian eloped with in June 2022. Most recently, the loved-up pair announced <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>the birth</a> of their son, <strong>Seiko Aurelius Grenier</strong>, on Jun. 8, 2023. “We are happy to announce the arrival of our son who was born a few weeks ago.

One of the most important parts of the ceremony had to be improvised, much like the rest of it: the wedding rings! “We embraced the serendipity of the moment and made the decision to tie the knot — literally, we didn’t have rings so used string for rings,” Adrian told the outlet.</p><h2>A Friend Got Ordained Over His Cell Phone To Marry The Couple</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Jordan-Roemmele-5-things-ss-embed2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-9>Speaking of improvisation, another aspect that had to be winged was an officiant to wed Adrian and Jordan! Fortunately, the crowd had wifi in the Atlas Mountains! Adrian told the news source that his musician friend RY X “got ordained on his cell phone at dinner — good thing we had wifi — in order to officiate the wedding, and then sang beautifully after that.”</p><h2>The Couple Were First Linked In 2017</h2><p id=content-paragraph-10>While the couple are extremely low-key with their relationship, it has been reported that they started off the red-hot romance back in 2017. According to their Instagram accounts, they have recently moved to Austin, TX and have spoken out about starting a wildlife sanctuary.</p><h2>Jordan Calls Her Husband ‘Endless Magic’</h2><p id=content-paragraph-11>Taking to her Instagram on June 24, 2022, the gorgeous new bride shared a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>photo album</a> of the fantastical wedding in Morocco. Alongside the stunning snaps, she wrote, “I am so proud of our journey. I am elated to call you my husband and to live a life infused with your endless magic. I’m honored to love you & be loved by you. I respect the work you have done, all the things you have laid down and picked up in order to love me better. I am in awe of you in every moment; the way you love, give, and interact with the world. Your magnetic presence brings joy to those around you.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmaho2K3sL7DmqVmqp%2Bauq6xy55kbW9na315g44%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./brittany-b.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Brittany B.</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./will-sasso-underwent-two-skin-surgeries-vigours-training-to-tone-down-excess-body-weight-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Will Sasso Underwent Two Skin Surgeries &amp;amp; Vigorous Training to Tone down Excess Body Weight</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-offensive-t-shirts-that-have-been-removed-from-stores.html>15 Most Offensive T-Shirts Ever</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./extreme-makeover-jillian-harris-edition.html>Extreme Makeover: Jillian Harris Edition!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lizzy-mcalpine-tour-2022-how-buy-tickets.html>Lizzy McAlpine tour 2022: How can I buy tickets?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nichole-lynel.html>Nichole Lynel</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./teddy-afro.html>Teddy Afro</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 LoopBlog.
