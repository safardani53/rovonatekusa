In the Netflix original show, he plays the role of Friendly Orderly / Number One / Vecna / Henry Creel.</p><p>However, this isn’t the first time that the actor has been a part of a world-renowned franchise. He was also in the <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://glamourbuff.com/tag/harry-potter/ rel="noreferrer noopener">Harry Potter</a> franchise, having played Young Gellert Grindelwald in&nbsp;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 and Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald.</p><p>In addition, he has been a part of the <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://glamourbuff.com/actor/taylor-lautner-weight/ rel="noreferrer noopener">Twilight Saga</a> movies. He portrayed the role of Caius in 2011’s The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn – Part 1 and reprised the same role in Part 2, which came out in 2012.</p><p>Although a short career in terms of his number of acting gigs, Bower has earned massive fame, all thanks to his skills. So, there is no denying that he has an uprising yet flourishing acting career.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who is Jamie Campbell Bower dating?</h2><p>Aside from a fruitful acting career, the 33-year-old Bower also has a blissful personal life with his present girlfriend, despite having setbacks in his previous relationships.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>As of this writing, the actor is in a romantic relationship with his girlfriend Jess Moloney. Moloney is reportedly a creative agent and co-founder of Ice Studios — a company that serves as a creative community for many artists and has offices in both London and New York.</p><p>Coming over to Bower and Moloney’s relationship, it has been reported that the couple has been dating since early 2021; however, it’s currently unknown how and where they met and when they officially began dating.</p><p>Their relationship first became public in late June 2022 when <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://pagesix.com/2022/06/27/stranger-things-star-jamie-campbell-bower-kisses-mystery-woman/ rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Page Six</a> exclusively published some pictures of them sharing a PDA-filled moment at a beach in Malibu, California. Sources had tipped the outlet that the two were dating for a year and a half.</p><p>A month before that, the two had accompanied each other at the premiere of Stranger Things Season 4. At the time, the nature of their togetherness was seemingly unknown. But it surely raised some speculations, which were eventually answered by sources on Page Six.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>That said, some things are sure about their relationship: it has been going on smoothly, and the two like to spend as much time as possible alongside each other. For instance, on July 18, 2022, Moloney posted a picture with Bower when they attended an event for Saint Laurent.</p><p>The boyfriend-girlfriend duo also shares a mutual love for tattoos, as they have multiple inks across their body. Besides, it could even be said that Bower’s girlfriend is dripped with tattoos from head to toe, as seen in her pictures.</p><p>Likewise, the couple shares a love for outdoor things as well. In March 2023, Bower and Moloney were <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://twitter.com/BowerxDepp/status/1639557004363706369 rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">seen</a> at a fan-signing event, where Bower introduced Moloney to the fans. And in May 2023, the actor <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://www.instagram.com/p/CsFG60fvM6L/ rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">shared</a> a picture in which he was seen horse riding with his partner.</p><p>Furthermore, the two were recently spotted rock climbing in Culver City by some fans. As per the fans, the romantic couple looked “very happy laughing and joking and were both very sweet.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Jamie-Campbell-Bower-new-girlfriend-rock-climbing.jpg><p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size">A DeuxMoi tipster spotted Jamie Campbell Bower and Jess Moloney rock climbing (Photo: Instagram)</p><p>To conclude, it seems like Bower and Moloney are having the best of times since they began dating. And who knows, if this relationship continues, netizens might even see them share the wedding vows.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jamie Campbell Bower was previously dating Ruby Quilter</h2><p>Before his relationship with Moloney blossomed, Bower was dating his now-former girlfriend Ruby Quilter. Quilter is a tattoo artist, around 29 years of age, who has been working in the inking field since she was 21, per her 2018 interview with Things & Ink.</p><p>As per reports, Bower and Quilter met each other in the latter part of 2018 in the London-based Sang Bleu Tattoo shop. After some time, they eventually started dating and were spotted multiple times on different occasions.</p><p>The couple went public with their romance in November 2018, when Quilter accompanied Bower at the premiere of Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes Of Grindelwald in London. However, as the two preferred privacy, they didn’t shed much light on their relationship.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Jamie-Campbell-Bower-girlfriend-Ruby-Quilter.jpg><p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size">Jamie Campbell Bower with his girlfriend Ruby Quilter in 2018 (Photo: Getty Images)</p><p>They occasionally featured each other on their social media handles, and after some time, it was difficult to know if they were still dating. But it was confirmed Bower and Quilter had broken up in June 2020 when Page Six confirmed Bower’s romance with Moloney.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jamie Campbell Bower was once engaged to Bonnie Wright</h2><p>Years before he started dating his present girlfriend, Bower was <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://glamourbuff.com/relationship/bonnie-wright-potential-husband-andrew/ rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">engaged to be married</a> to his co-star Bonnie Wright. The former duo first met each other when they shared the screen on Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1.</p><p>Their professional friendship eventually turned into a romantic relationship, a thing that was kept a secret until the 2010 BAFTAs. During the event, Wright officially confirmed she was dating Bower and said, “Yes, we’re dating. We’ve been seeing each other for a few months; it’s good.”</p><p>Over a year after going public, on April 10, 2011, Bower revealed his engagement to Wright in his interview with The Daily. He said, “I am engaged. I’m very happy. It’s a wonderful, wonderful time.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Bonnie-Wright-with-former-fiance-Jamie-Campbell-Bower.jpg><p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size">Jamie Campbell Bower with his former fiance Bonnie Wright (Photo: mylondon.news)</p><p>And when he was asked about a possible wedding anytime soon, the actor said, “We are planning, but I won’t say when and I won’t say where. Or how.”</p><p>However, the wedding never came as Bower and Wright called off their engagement in July 2012. At the time, an insider told US Weekly, “Bonnie and Jamie split a while ago. It was amicable, but things had not been going right for some time. It’s sad.”</p><p>As of now, <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://glamourbuff.com/news/bonnie-wright-married-andrew-lococo/ rel="noreferrer noopener">Wright is happily married</a> to her longtime boyfriend turned husband Andrew Lococo.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jamie Campbell Bower’s off and on relationship with Lily Collins</h2><p>Shortly after his split with Wright, Bower moved on and <a href=# data-type=URL data-id="https://www.popsugar.com/celebrity/jamie-campbell-bower-dating-48847341?stream_view=1#photo-48847345" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">started dating</a> <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://glamourbuff.com/news/lily-collins-filming-emily-in-paris-season-3/ rel="noreferrer noopener">Emily in Paris</a> star <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://glamourbuff.com/actress/lily-collins-age-parents-height-net-worth/ rel="noreferrer noopener">Lily Collins</a>.</p><p>The now-former pair first met while working together on their movie The Mortals Instruments: City of Bones and eventually started dating. However, days before their movie hit the theaters, the two parted ways in July 2013.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Lily Collins and Jamie Campbell Bower appreciation tweet ✨ <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/DFGCihdh52</a></p>— RT or LIKE (@RTorFAV_1) <a href=# rel=noopener>December 29, 2017</a><p>Though separated, they remained friends and were present during the premiere of their movie in Los Angeles. At the premiere, Bower told E! News, “We’re tight. Lily and I are very, very close. Very close. Always have been, always will be.”</p><p>Almost two years after they went down separate roads, Bower and Collins reunited in May 2015. The actress had even shared a picture with Bower via Instagram in which she was kissing him. “Life works in mysterious ways….,” she captioned her post.</p><p>Their reunion seemed well initially, but little did anyone know they weren’t staying together forever. By the end of 2015, Bower and Collins had once again broken up.</p><p>After their short-lived reunion, many weren’t thinking that reconciliation between them would happen again. But, to people’s shock, that did happen as the two got back together for the second time in January 2018.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Unfortunately, the second reunion lasted even shorter than the first one as they split for good in July 2018. At the time, DailyMail reported that their breakup was amicable.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jamie Campbell Bower’s dating history</h2><p>Apart from his relationships with Wright and Collins, Bower has been in multiple other relationships.</p><p>Among them, the first one was with fashion designer Zoe Graham. They began their relationship in 2007 and were caught having PDA-filled moments on several occasions. But, in late 2009, the two parted ways due to unknown reasons.&nbsp;</p><p>After that, Bower began dating Spanish model Zina Charkoplia. Their relationship started in 2013 — during Bower’s on-and-off relationship with Collins. However, their romance didn’t last long, as they eventually parted ways.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Jamie-Campbell-Bower-ex-girlfriend-Matilda-Lowther.jpg><p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size">Jamie Campbell Bower with his ex-girlfriend Matilda Lowther (Photo: <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://twitter.com/Burberry/status/486193046946848768/photo/1 rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter</a>)</p><p>Following Bower’s split with Charkoplia, the actor started dating runway model Matilda Lowther in March 2014 — they had met while working together in Burberry’s Brit-tastic campaign.</p><p>In October 2014, the couple looked synced up as they showed up at the BAFTA Breakthrough Brits 2014 party. But, sometime later, they seemingly parted ways due to unknown reasons.</p><p>After that, Bower got back together with Collins, but when he and Collins again broke up, Bower reconciled his relationship with Lowther in March 2016. Their reunion was proved when they were seen together at the Maid’s Gala Night in London.</p><p>Bower and Lowther’s reconciled relationship lasted for more than a year, as they ended things for good in November 2017.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifnJa6sMHRm6yfnl6YvK57wJyrqKpfn66utcRmmpqloJeyrbiMm6awnaJisaLAyKeeZp%2BZp7mnvsiepZ1n</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-jay-mcgraw-dating.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Jay McGraw Dating Now</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-drew-seeley-dating.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Drew Seeley Dating Now</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-offensive-t-shirts-that-have-been-removed-from-stores.html>15 Most Offensive T-Shirts Ever</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./extreme-makeover-jillian-harris-edition.html>Extreme Makeover: Jillian Harris Edition!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lizzy-mcalpine-tour-2022-how-buy-tickets.html>Lizzy McAlpine tour 2022: How can I buy tickets?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nichole-lynel.html>Nichole Lynel</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./teddy-afro.html>Teddy Afro</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 LoopBlog.
