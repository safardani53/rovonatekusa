He showed her videos and pictures from his phone but it seemed like a business meeting more then a date.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>It has since been revealed that Ashley is in fact dating Justin’s friend <strong>Lil Twist</strong>, and that she and Justin were just discussing work. So what is his big business opportunity for her?</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>“He is thinking of casting her in a new music video,” says a source close to Justin. How interesting! Plus, the source added that Justin would never break boy code.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>“She is his boys girl, and he will not steal her from Lil Twist who really likes her. It’s strictly friends only!”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>So is Ashley going to be Justin’s “Heartbreaker”?</p><h3>Justin’s History With Ashley</h3><p id=content-paragraph-8>Ashley has actually been part of Justin’s crew for a long time, due to her on/off romance with Twist.&nbsp;Most recently,&nbsp;Ashley was seen partying with Justin&nbsp;and his friends July 4, and guess who else was there?</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Selena!</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>That was the same day that Justin instagrammed a picture of them together, and wrote the word “Heartbreaker,” the name of his newest song. Perhaps, that is when he was inspired to cast Ashley!</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>As for Justin and Selena? Their relationship status remains in question — the last we heard, they’d decided to become&nbsp;friends with benefits.</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>What do YOU think <strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>?
