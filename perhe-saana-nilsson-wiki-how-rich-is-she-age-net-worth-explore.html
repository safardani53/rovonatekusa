Saana Nilsson, chief of staff of the Protection Police, gave half of the Seven a tour of Supo’s headquarters in Helsinki’s Ratakatu, which were finally vacant a week ago.&nbsp;Supo and its predecessors were able to do business there for nearly a century until indoor air quality difficulties forced them to shift, first to covered space, and then the following year to a new office in Kaartinkaupunki, which is presently under construction.&nbsp;Saana described every part of the tour and helped many people understand how the workplace works.&nbsp;Over the last decade, money for police protection has more than doubled. Among the elements leading to the growth of the protection police is the intelligence law that entered into force in the summer of 2019.</p><h2>Perhe Saana Nilsson Wiki</h2><p>The Wikipedia article for Perhe Saana Nilsson is currently inaccessible on the internet. As a result, many people have difficulty obtaining precise information regarding her age and parents.&nbsp;Despite the absence of a Wikipedia article, Perhee Saana Nilsson’s LinkedIn profile has information on her. Nilsson is the current chief of partnerships at the Finnish Security and Intelligence Service, according to her LinkedIn profile.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Perhe-Saana-Nilsson-1.jpg alt="Perhe Saana Nilsson" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The most recent edition of Half Seven featured Saana Nilsson. She started working as an archive trainee with the protection police in 2009.&nbsp;The Wikipedia article for Perhe Saana Nilsson is missing. As a result, there is no information on Saana’s age or family background available online.&nbsp;The political history student was so taken by Supo that she applied for three internships. The head of staff was thinking about where she might do an internship linked to her studies that would be the most interesting. While collecting the archives of Supo’s previous leaders, she came upon a document called Tiitisen’s list.</p><p>Nilsson rose through the ranks to become the chief analyst and director of social relations with the government.&nbsp;Saana is currently the chief of staff, in charge of the day-to-day operations of Supo. Nilsson believes that the finest component of the activity is a certain form of franticness.&nbsp;Several events are going place. Another factor that is important to me and many other Supo workers is that the job is actually meaningful.&nbsp;As Nilsson remarked, being able to contribute to the security of Finland and Finns makes her feel extremely fantastic.</p><h2>Saana Nilsson Net Worth</h2><p>The internet is devoid of information on Saana Nilsson’s net worth.&nbsp;She does, however, have a good salary as the chief of partnerships at the Finnish Security and Intelligence Service.&nbsp;The financing for the Protection Police (SUPO), which has lately come under fire, has more than tripled in the last 10 years.&nbsp;Supo had a budget of roughly 18 million euros in 2013, but it was already close to 64 million euros in 2016.</p><p>The inquiry has significantly reduced the strain. Furthermore, additional staff members were hired, and there are now over 520 individuals working there. According to Saana Nilsson, Supo’s chief of staff, the organization’s budget is presently projected to be about 64 million euros per year and has been met.&nbsp;As a result, Saana’s net worth might vary from hundreds to a million dollars, in comparison to her pay from her occupation.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Perhe-Saana-Nilsson-2.jpg alt="Perhe Saana Nilsson" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Saana Nilsson is the Protection Police’s public relations officer.
