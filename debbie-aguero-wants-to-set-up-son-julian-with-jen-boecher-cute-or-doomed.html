And she wants to set them up.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>As Jen Boecher’s portion of Season 4, Episode 15 began, Jen worried that Rishi hadn’t fully accepted the split.</p><p>She was not wrong. Rishi had just been at the temple, looking despondent and seeking spiritual guidance.</p><p>Jen met with Rishi, face to face, but not to reconcile. Her hope was that, once she leaves India for good, he will accept the breakup for what it is.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/05/0515_theotherway_tellall_23_debbieaguero-1024x576.png><p>Sitting face to face in an extremely humid setting, Rishi told Jen that he’s struggling to come to terms with the split.</p><p>After all, he and Jen spent three years engaged.</p><p>Sure, they were apart for most of that time. And he kept it a secret from his family until the very end. But they were planning to marry and spend their lives together.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>But, though Jen was the one who gave him back his ring, they both knew that this was Rishi’s choice.</p><p>Rishi was the one who was unwilling to go against his mother and uncle’s wishes.</p><p>He could have chosen to stand up for himself and his relationship. Instead, he chose his mom’s demands. He will have to live with that mistake for the rest of his life, wondering what might have been.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Or will he?</p><p>There were some hints at the Tell All special that suggest that perhaps Jen and Rishi aren’t completely done with each other.</p><p>For those answers, we’ll have to wait for the Tell All Part 2 (or beyond).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>So, we saw the Tell All Part 1. We did not get any focus upon Jen and Rishi. Not yet.</p><p>However, before diving into Nicole and Mahmoud’s story (and Mahmoud’s explosive tantrum), the Tell All addressed Debbie and Oussama.</p><p>They’re still broken up, despite Oussama’s substantial efforts to win her back. He sent her hundreds of texts and called her many times. In some messages, he told her “I love you.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Oussama made multiple statements at the Tell All that directly contradicted his previous on-camera admissions.</p><p>For that matter, some of his claims at the Tell All were mutually exclusive. Simply put, he had to be lying about something.</p><p>Some of his castmates concluded that he simply dislikes the conflict, so he makes whatever claim will calm things down. Unless he’s angry. It seems that this may be where some of the truth slips out with him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Fortunately, Debbie was not alone when she confronted him.</p><p>Numerous castmates leapt at the chance to defend her. They had watched this season, too. And everyone likes Debbie.</p><p>But the real standout came when her son, Julian, stepped out onto the Tell All stage to tell Oussama exactly what he thinks of him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Julian did not mince words when he called out Oussama for his behavior. This drew cheers from Debbie’s castmates, including (and especially) Jen.</p><p>Among other things, he described some stalker-like tendencies as Oussama attempted to bombard Debbie with affectionate messages.</p><p>As Julian told him to stop pestering his mother and to instead get a job, Oussama only worsened people’s opinions of him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>“No, I will not get a job, because I’m a poet,” is not really going to go over well with … anyone, really.</p><p>Look, we all wish that we didn’t live in a hellscape where the vast majority of people have to labor for others just to stay alive. To get cool stuff? Sure! But to keep a roof over your head and food in your fridge? It truly sucks.</p><p>But Oussama’s reluctance to work (or even sell his paintings to tourists — at the risk of them hanging it in their living rooms) is his problem, and should not be Debbie’s. Julian told him as much, and firmly.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>During a break, Julian and Debbie embraced. Julian spoke to her very relatably (at least, for many of us), encouraging her to worry less about Oussama and more about herself.</p><p>Meanwhile, Debbie observed that Jen had really enjoyed Julian’s role on the episode. And she asked him if she could slip her his number.</p><p>Julian felt very on-the-spot (which is precisely where Debbie had put him), but he didn’t mind. If Jen really is single, we wonder if we’ll get an update on this. But there’s a chance that it’s a moot point.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2trX2WCcLDEm5minV2WtLax0ahksJmeqcBuwM5mqp6sXaq9br%2FOp2SjrZyerq951qKroWWamrturs6emqGdomKwtsDEZqarZZSkvK6xw2g%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./nicky-hiltons-stroller-comes-complete-with-gold-angel-wings-w435035.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Nicky Hiltons Stroller Comes Complete With Gold Angel Wings</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./christina-anstead-files-for-divorce-from-husband-ant-after-less-than-2-years-of-marriage.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Christina Anstead Files for Divorce from Husband Ant After Less Than 2 Years of Marriage</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-offensive-t-shirts-that-have-been-removed-from-stores.html>15 Most Offensive T-Shirts Ever</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./extreme-makeover-jillian-harris-edition.html>Extreme Makeover: Jillian Harris Edition!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lizzy-mcalpine-tour-2022-how-buy-tickets.html>Lizzy McAlpine tour 2022: How can I buy tickets?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nichole-lynel.html>Nichole Lynel</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./teddy-afro.html>Teddy Afro</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 LoopBlog.
