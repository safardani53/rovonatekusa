During the May 21 Livestream event, the Foo Fighters announced introduced Josh, 50, as the new addition to the band, joining <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Dave Grohl</a>,</strong> <strong>Nate Mendel, Pat Smear, Chris Shiflett,&nbsp;</strong>and<strong> Rami Jaffe.</strong></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Thanks for joining us.

The LP is set for a June 2 release via Roswell Records/Columbia Records. The band released “Under You” last week. The group also <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>announced a run of tour dates</a>, kicking off on May 24 in New Hampshire.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>As the world prepares to welcome Josh as the newest Foo, here’s what you need to know about him.</p><h2><strong>Josh Freese Has Been Drumming For Decades.</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-9>Josh Freese (b. Dec. 25, 1972) has been playing the drums since he was eight years old. “My dad conducted the Disneyland band since I was born, and I was around big band music a lot,” Josh said in a 2014 interview with <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Vice</a>. “There was always a bunch of instruments around our house, and I noticed there was a drum set up in our attic. I thought there was no chance in hell my parents would let me take it down and set it up for me, but somehow they went for it. My dad played me the most elementary Rock ‘n’ Roll 101 beat, and I sat down and immediately played it. I fell in love instantly.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/josh-freese-foo-fighters-drummer-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-10>Around 8, he started “taking lessons around that time,” he said in a 2007 interview with <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>GuitarCenter.com</a>. “For a year or so prior to taking lessons, I’d been practicing to records. When I was 8 years old, it was <strong>Van Halen, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Devo</a>, Queen, Journey, and The Police</strong>…..shortly after that came Missing Persons, <strong>The Ramones, </strong>and my huge <strong>Frank Zappa</strong> phase that I went through. Then, of course, jazz fusion phase and then landed on punk rock when I was about 16.”</p><h2><strong>He Got His Start As A Pre-Teen.</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-11>“In 1985, when I was 12, I got a job playing in a Top 40 band out at Disneyland,” Josh told Vice. For the next 38+ years, Josh has worked as a professional drummer. “Other than a paper route I had for about six weeks when I was 10, this is the only job I’ve ever had.”</p><h2><strong>Josh Has Played With His Heroes…</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-12>“I grew up a huge Devo fan,” Josh told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Modern Drummer</a> in 2005, “but by the time I was eleven or twelve, I had read many articles in Modern Drummer with <strong>Terry Bozzio</strong>, <strong>Vinnie Colaiuta</strong>, and <strong>Chad Wackerman</strong>, where they were saying, ‘Playing with Frank Zappa was so challenging – playing with Frank was so this – playing with Frank was so that.'” Josh bought all the Zappa records he could, and it seems that he was setting up some kismet. He would have a chance meeting with <strong>Ahmet Zappa</strong>, Frank’s son, who introduced him to his brother, <strong>Dweezil Zappa</strong>. Josh began touring and recording with Dweezil.</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>In 1989, Josh – full into his punk phrase – met up with SoCal punkers <strong>The Vandals</strong>. They were in need of a drummer, and Josh slid in behind the kit. He’s played with them ever since and has been on all of their albums, except for Look What I Almost Stepped In, because Josh had other commitments.</p><p id=content-paragraph-14>In 1995, Josh became a permanent member of the reformed <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>DEVO</a>, playing with another band that inspired him. “[Freedom of Choice] was the first album I got when I was eight years old,” he told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>SPIN</a>. “I sat in my basement and played along to it all the time, so it was crazy when we did that tour last year where we played it top to bottom. It’s fun in the way that it’s very metronomic and the patterns are very deliberate and kind of nursery rhyme. A lot of people think that it’s a drum machine on ‘Whip It.’ But that’s <strong>Alan Myers.</strong>”</p><h2><strong>…And All Of Your Favorite Bands.</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-15>Josh calls himself a “freelance drummer to the stars,” and he has the resume to back it up. “Freese ….has racked up more than 500 total recording credits and countless shows—by his own estimate—working with everyone from the <strong>Offspring</strong> to <strong>Paramore</strong> to <strong>Weezer</strong> to <strong>Avril Lavigne</strong>,” wrote Vice in 2014. His <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>AllMusic</a> page shows that he’s worked with bands and artists like <strong>Mike Ness, Chris Cornell, A Perfect Circle, Rob Zombie, 3 Doors Down, Unwritten Law, Guns N’ Roses, Ween, Static-X, Kelly Clarkson, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Monster Magnet</a>, Steve Vai, The Replacements, </strong>and countless others.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/josh-freese-foo-fighters-drummer-embed2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-16>“I always tell people, ‘Play with as many people as you can play with, without burning all bridges or fucking things up for yourself,'” he told Vice. “You’ve got to be sensitive to people’s schedules and treat them all like they’re the most important one. Get out there and play with whoever you can. You’ve got to play for free; you can’t demand money. Play with everyone for free and just get out there because you never know between making connections with others—not just musically but personally.”</p><h2><strong>Peers & Fans Praised Him Being Picked For The Foo Fighters Gig.</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-17>Josh Freese was a friend of the Foo Fighters before he joined the band in 2023. After the world lost Taylor Hawkins, Josh partook in the tribute shows, performing alongside <strong>The Darkness’</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Justin Hawkins</strong> and <strong>Wolfgang Van Halen </strong>for a performance of “All My Life,” per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Loudwire</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-18>When the Foos announced that Josh would join them on the road as their drummer, the decision was universally praised. “My biggest drumming inspiration and probably the main reason I didn’t give up when my first band stopped touring,” tweeted <strong>Dashboard Confessional </strong>drummer <strong>Chris Kamrada.</strong> “He’s living proof of what it takes to handle playing for so many different respectable artists. well done, Foo Fighters.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-19>“Foo Fighters could not have made a better decision,” added <strong>Steve Stevens</strong>, guitarist for <strong>Billy Idol</strong>. “[Josh Freese] is the best of the best.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmaho2K3sL%2FHZp2rnZWosm6BkGlrbm5nZA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-stan-shaw-dating.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Stan Shaw Dating Now</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-knight-before-christmas-movie-photos.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Knight Before Christmas Movie Photos Hollywood Life</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-offensive-t-shirts-that-have-been-removed-from-stores.html>15 Most Offensive T-Shirts Ever</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./extreme-makeover-jillian-harris-edition.html>Extreme Makeover: Jillian Harris Edition!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lizzy-mcalpine-tour-2022-how-buy-tickets.html>Lizzy McAlpine tour 2022: How can I buy tickets?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nichole-lynel.html>Nichole Lynel</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./teddy-afro.html>Teddy Afro</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 LoopBlog.
