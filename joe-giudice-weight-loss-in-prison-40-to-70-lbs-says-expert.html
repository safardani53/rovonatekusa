The Situation even <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">left an encouraging note</a> on 18-year-old Gia’s October 14 Instagram. “The comeback is always greater than the setback,” the Jersey Shore: Family Vacation star commented on Gia’s post. “Sending positive vibes.”</p><p>Abdwell agrees that the reality star, who <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">served 41 months in prison for fraud</a>, looks much leaner. “Joe has lost a lot of body fat, it’s most evident in his face and his stomach,” says the nutritionist. “When someone loses a sizable amount of body fat, the greatest indicators are in the belly area and around the face, which Joe has clearly done.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Teresa-and-Joe-Giudice-Heavy-Before-Jail.jpg><p>“Joe is looking amazing, his skin is looking smoother and even his eyes more bright which indicate a healthier lifestyle,” adds the Massachusetts-based personal trainer.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Us Weekly confirmed</a> on Friday, October 11, that Joe had been freed from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody and headed to his native Italy. “He is en route to Italy right now. He spoke to Teresa and Gia from the plane and he is extremely happy to be released, more than words can describe,” James Leonard, the family’s lawyer, told Us. “We are still fighting and it is his desire to return home to the United States to be reunited with his family.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Joe-Giudice-After-Jail-Lost-70-Pounds-Instagram.jpg><p>Gia’s Instagram post showed her father reunited with his brother, Pete, in Italy, and revealed the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">family’s trip to see him</a> will happen soon. “So happy [you’re] together right now.. enjoy see you in a few weeks daddy❤️❤️,” she wrote.</p><p>With reporting by Travis Cronin</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGajp5VitKrBw6KanmWnmraotNNmo6iro2K2r3nPq6Csp55igXF506hkcGhdoa%2B0edKasKxlla29pr7TaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./king-los.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>King Los</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./how-bijou-phillips-is-coping-amid-divorce-from-danny-masterson.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How Bijou Phillips Is Coping Amid Divorce From Danny Masterson</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-offensive-t-shirts-that-have-been-removed-from-stores.html>15 Most Offensive T-Shirts Ever</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./extreme-makeover-jillian-harris-edition.html>Extreme Makeover: Jillian Harris Edition!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lizzy-mcalpine-tour-2022-how-buy-tickets.html>Lizzy McAlpine tour 2022: How can I buy tickets?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nichole-lynel.html>Nichole Lynel</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./teddy-afro.html>Teddy Afro</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 LoopBlog.
