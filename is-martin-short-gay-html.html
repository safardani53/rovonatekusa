He claimed that it was never his intention to portray Franck as a gay guy.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Instead, he mentioned that Frank especially caught his attention because he preferred playing characters that have unusual, heightened, and/or eccentric behavior that the audience might find funny.&nbsp;Frank just happened to meet those prerequisites.&nbsp;</p><p>Short then went on to explain that discerning gay from straight was not as straightforward as most might expect. He added,&nbsp;</p><p>It’s often very hard to figure out who’s gay. I’ve met really effeminate people who are surprisingly sincerely straight. And then the opposite.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>The actor also claimed that he often met people like Franck in real life too. But, more often than not, those people would be happily married with a wife and eight kids.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The outlet further reported that Franck was a relatively difficult character for the production to fit into the movie. The character was mostly an improvised flowery persona that had to be tucked neatly into what was already a sweet and sincere flick.&nbsp;</p><h2>Is Martin Short Gay?</h2><p>Despite Short's statement, people often put him squarely into the gay bracket&nbsp;or question if he is gay because he played a flamboyant role in a popular movie.&nbsp;</p><p>Contrary to public belief, Short is not gay, and he once had a wife by the name of&nbsp;Nancy Dolman. Sadly, she passed away in 2010.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>According to a report from <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">People</a> at the time, Dolman died relatively young, at the age of 58. The LA County Cotoner&nbsp;Chief Craig Harvey told the outlet that Dolman was under the care of a physician for a natural disease prior to her death.&nbsp;</p><p>He further clarified that there would be no coroner involvement on the matter. However, he did not mention the name of the illness that plagued Short's late wife.&nbsp;</p><p>The outlet got its hands on a 2007 report that claimed Dolman had been battling cancer but opted to keep the source undisclosed.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>On a later date, Short confessed to <a href=# rel=follow>Larry King</a> that his wife's death was not sudden and that she battled for three whole years before the disease got the better of her.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Martin Short's Wife Was Still with Him</h2><p>In a 2019 cover story with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">AARP</a>, Short announced that his marriage with Dolman was a triumph. Even after nine years since her passing, <a href=# rel=follow>Short claimed that he communicated with her</a> all the time.&nbsp;</p><p>He admitted to often considering her response to a certain decision before making it, especially when it came to their three kids:&nbsp;Katherine,&nbsp;Oliver,&nbsp;and Henry.</p><p>Short also openly refuted the idea of not speaking about the dead and assuming that everything ends at death. Instead, he believed those ideas stemmed from a place of denial, where people refuse to believe that they, too, are mortals.&nbsp;</p><p>So to him, his wife was always with him, and the tragedy of losing her left him&nbsp;emboldened. He admitted that he had become a little more daring since she left.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKGjYrqivtOipWarmKS%2FtXnGmrBnoKSiuQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./maxx-chewning-19890909-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Maxx Chewning (YouTube Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-jeff-mauros-wife-sarah-food-network.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Jeff Mauro's wife?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-offensive-t-shirts-that-have-been-removed-from-stores.html>15 Most Offensive T-Shirts Ever</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./extreme-makeover-jillian-harris-edition.html>Extreme Makeover: Jillian Harris Edition!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lizzy-mcalpine-tour-2022-how-buy-tickets.html>Lizzy McAlpine tour 2022: How can I buy tickets?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nichole-lynel.html>Nichole Lynel</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./teddy-afro.html>Teddy Afro</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 LoopBlog.
