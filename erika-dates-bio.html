Also, Erika is a petite lady standing at the height of 5 feet 4 inches (1.64 meters).</p><p>In contrast, her husband stands tall at 6 feet 10 inches (2.08 meters). But we do not fall in love with this person for their tallness, do we?</p><p>Furthermore, the African-American weighs around 54 kg (119 pounds) which bodes well with her body stature.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/erika-981.jpg></p><p>In like manner, Dates being a celebrity herself intent on keeping herself fit and presentable.</p><p>From the photos that managed to surface, we can see that Dates has a broad forehead, plump lips, and a rounded facial structure.</p><h2>Career As An Activist</h2><p>To begin with, Erika is a social worker, and her career is entirely independent of her husband’s fame.
