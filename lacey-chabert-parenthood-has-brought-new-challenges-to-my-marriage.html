The sleep deprivation, it’s hard, it’s challenging in ways that more than other things have been to me.”</p><p><a href=#>The actress, 35, welcomed daughter Julia,</a> now 21 months, with husband <strong>David Nehdar</strong> in September 2016.</p><p>“My husband is obsessed with her,” she added while attending the Step Up Inspiration Awards on Friday, June 1. “It’s amazing how for your relationship too, it creates new challenges but having her and raising her together, it’s truly brought us together in a really beautiful way.”</p><p>Chabert admits that the couple “haven’t been great” about making time for each other, but learned early on that it was important to. “We were so scared to leave her in the beginning, so we thought better realizing that we had to spend time just us. We’ll be better parents for it. We’re finding that balance,” she added. “I think with any new parent, it’s just hard in the beginning because you don’t want to ever leave her.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Perhaps a showing of Mean Girls on Broadway could be a date night. She noted: “I haven’t seen it yet, but I want to. We’re talking about trying to go this month. I hope to go soon. It looks amazing … I am blessed to have been part of that project.” (Chabert played Gretchen Wieners in the 2014 film.)</p><p>In the meantime, they are enjoying spending time with their “fun” little girl. “Everything is new, it’s really brought a whimsical side to my life back in a way,” she told Us. “She’s obsessed with Peppa Pig and Disneyland. We have an annual pass now, and we’ve gone a few times. Everything is Minnie Mouse. She loves clothes and watches me get dressed and put on makeup, and she imitates everything I do. We do our nails together – of course non-toxic nail polish. She’s not only my precious daughter, she’s like my buddy also.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGalmZOaxm6vx5qZnqqkYr2ivsSnq6Gnn5l6qa3SZpmrp6WctbV5zZ6uZpuYlrmtsc2gnKxlpKR6rsWMppirqpmWtKZ7</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./olga-korbut.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Olga Korbut</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./bm-selling-mini-millions-sweet-dispenser-shoppers-wild.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>B&amp;amp;M is selling a Mini Millions sweet dispenser for 2.99... and shoppers are going wild for it</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-offensive-t-shirts-that-have-been-removed-from-stores.html>15 Most Offensive T-Shirts Ever</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./extreme-makeover-jillian-harris-edition.html>Extreme Makeover: Jillian Harris Edition!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lizzy-mcalpine-tour-2022-how-buy-tickets.html>Lizzy McAlpine tour 2022: How can I buy tickets?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nichole-lynel.html>Nichole Lynel</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./teddy-afro.html>Teddy Afro</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 LoopBlog.
