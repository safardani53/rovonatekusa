However, things went from bad to worse when his Calabasas home was looted by two criminals on November 12.</p><p>According to law enforcement officials, the heist occurred around 8:30 p.m. when the criminals shattered the rear door and entered the property. The rapper’s home was outfitted with a Ring camera, which informed his staff, who quickly phoned the police.&nbsp;The thieves fled the home before the police arrived. While the assets stolen from his home are unclear, rumors indicate that two bags full of stuff were taken from the singer’s home.&nbsp;Investigators are presently waiting for the artist to return so that they may get information about the stolen objects. So yet, no arrests have been made by the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department.</p><p></p><h2>Nas has made a lot of money through his successful music career.</h2><p>Nas is widely regarded as one of the greatest rappers of all time, while his father, Olu Dara, is a cornetist, musician, and vocalist. He started his career in 1989 and also performed on the song “Live at the Barbeque” by Main Group.&nbsp;CelebrityNetWorth estimates the 49-year-net old’s worth to be about $70 million. He has amassed a substantial fortune as a result of his successful career as a rapper, earning $35 million between September 2017 and September 2018. Between September 2018 and September 2019, his net worth fell to $19 million.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Nas.jpg alt=Nas width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>In 2002, the New York City native paid $659,000 for a home in the Atlanta suburb of McDonough, Georgia. The home, which was constructed in 1999, contains two bedrooms, three full and one-half bathrooms, and a swimming pool.&nbsp;Jones and his then-wife Kelis then purchased a $1.6 million home in Los Angeles in 2007. The home, which was built in 1947, includes four baths and three bathrooms. In November 2021, he paid $3.5 million for another mansion in Calabasas, California.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Nas-1.jpg alt=Nas width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>His first album, Illmatic, was a huge success when it was released in 1994. This was followed by another album, It Was Written, which debuted at the top of the Billboard 200 in 1996.&nbsp;His following two albums, I Am and Nastradamus, were released in 1999 but were met with criticism from reviewers and fans who felt that the quality of his work was deteriorating.&nbsp;Stillmatic, God’s Son, Street’s Disciple, Hip Hop Is Dead, Life Is Good, King’s Disease II, King’s Disease III, and more albums were released by the Halftime vocalist. In 2010, he worked with Damian Marley on the album Distant Relatives.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGifqK9dp7aktIyiqmamkah6r7HTZq6oqqSdeqSt0Z6cq2Wjlrmivtho</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./denzel-washington-crashes-couples-wedding-photoshoot-while-on-a-walk-in-new-york-city.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Say Cheese!
