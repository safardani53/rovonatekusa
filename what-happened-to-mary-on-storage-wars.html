Thanks to the original program's resounding success, spinoffs such as Storage Wars: Texas were commissioned, further expanding the A&E show's universe and inviting pickers from across the nation to take part.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>One industrious treasure hunter who was tapped to take part in the spinoff show and has since endeared herself to fans more than most of its other stars is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mary Padian</a>. Over the course of a five-year period, Mary became an integral part of Storage Wars and one of the faces of the program that viewers kept up with the most. However, a recent lack of appearances from the star has left fans wondering what happened to Mary. So, what do we know about her whereabouts today?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What happened to Mary Padian on 'Storage Wars'?</h2><p>Mary was first tapped to join the Storage Wars: Texas universe back in 2012 when the show was created as a response to the resounding success of the original program. For two years, Mary wowed fans with her charming personality and prowess as a storage picker. Sadly, in 2014, Storage Wars: Texas was canceled, leaving Mary without a reality television gig temporarily.</p><p>This didn't last long, however, as fans petitioned for Mary to join the cast of the original Storage Wars, something that A&E obliged and made happen for the first time in the series' history. She joined the cast and wowed viewers in the exact same way that she did on the previous show, but her success didn't last long. At the end of Season 13 in 2019, it was announced that Storage Wars would be going on an indefinite hiatus. It was on hiatus until the Season 14 premiere on March 8, 2022.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>When the show was on hiatus, Mary frequently posted on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> to her over 300,000 followers, keeping them updated on her day-to-day life. The reality star is remaining busy and staying true to her picker roots even when not filming for Storage Wars. It seems her main focus for a while was her shop, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mary's Finds</a>, which sold various vintage clothing, accessories, and home goods. Unfortunately, she had to close the physical store, partly due to the lack of foot traffic during Covid, but she moved her goods online at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.marysfinds.com/.</a> The store online mainly features things she's upcycled from other sources, including storage units. She also returned to Texas after her time on Storage Wars ended.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Mary is also an advocate for a charitable organization called <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ubuntu Life</a>, which works to raise money to operate a clinic for children with neurological issues in Kenya by selling local crafts made by Kenyan women. She has frequently posted about the group and her affinity for their work on Instagram, even <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">joining forces</a> with Ubuntu Life to create and sell a "joy bracelet" with all profits going to those in need.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>Even with Mary no longer on the show, Storage Wars is back delivering the show's classic mix of drama, excitement, and wonder, a sigh of relief for fans who wholeheartedly missed the program during its extended hiatus. Besides, it seems as though Mary is doing quite well on her own from the looks of her Instagram page.</p><p>Be sure to check out new episodes of Storage Wars, airing Tuesdays at 9 p.m. EST on A&E.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTqGSmmaKuerC6jKyrqKqRnLJuw8Crqg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-glaiza-de-castro-dating.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Glaiza de Castro Dating Now</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./vanderpump-rules-season-5-episode-7-recap-the-sociopath-test.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jax Taylor is a Sociopath</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-offensive-t-shirts-that-have-been-removed-from-stores.html>15 Most Offensive T-Shirts Ever</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./extreme-makeover-jillian-harris-edition.html>Extreme Makeover: Jillian Harris Edition!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lizzy-mcalpine-tour-2022-how-buy-tickets.html>Lizzy McAlpine tour 2022: How can I buy tickets?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nichole-lynel.html>Nichole Lynel</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./teddy-afro.html>Teddy Afro</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 LoopBlog.
