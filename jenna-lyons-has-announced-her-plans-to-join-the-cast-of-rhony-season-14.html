News about her experience in a recent interview.&nbsp;Jenna will be one of six new housewives cast for the next season of Real Housewives of New York City (RHONY). She will make her season 14 debut with fellow New Yorkers Sai De Silva, Ubah Hassan, Erin Dana Lichy, Jessel Taank, and Brynn Whitfield. The cast was unveiled at BravoCon 2022 during a taping of Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen.</p><p>Season 14 of Real Housewives of New York City is planned to premiere next year. It will include an all-new cast of women with various origins and life experiences navigating their personal lives and jobs at the same time. The ladies are well-known in numerous fields, including fashion, real estate, and charity.</p><h2>Jenna Lyons was once a member of the HBO Max series Stylish.</h2><p>Although the forthcoming RHONY season will be Jenna’s first foray into the Real Housewives series, it will not be her first appearance on television. Jenna had her own reality program on HBO Max called Stylish, which followed Jenna and her team of designers as they worked on various projects.&nbsp;In the 2010s, the RHONY star came to prominence as the head designer for J.Crew. Her work popularized several design ideas, including “high-low clothing,” and won her the moniker “Woman Who Dresses America” after the huge success of her effort to resurrect the brand name.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Jenna-Lyons-1.jpg alt="Jenna Lyons" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Former CEO and Chairman Millard Drexler named the celebrity as executive creative director in 2008. In 2010, he appointed Jenna as president. In 2017, she announced her resignation from the firm.&nbsp;The Real Housewives of New York star attended Parsons School of Design in New York City. Bloch-Sulzberger syndrome was born to the former creative director and president of J. Crew. According to ABC News, the condition is “a hereditary ailment that may result in skin scarring, hair loss, and misshapen teeth.”</p><p>In an interview with The Guardian, she said that although the sickness made her feel uneasy, it also fueled her enthusiasm for and love of fashion. She stated:</p><p>“It made me introverted, but it was also the reason I liked fashion, because it has the power to transform who you are and how you feel, and that can be amazing.”</p><h2>Jenna Lyons discusses shooting RHONY season 14</h2><p>Jenna Lyons discussed her experience recording Season 14 on December 1, 2022, while attending the American Natural History Museum’s 2022 Gala in New York City. She said that she was cast in the next season of the Bravo series “by chance” when asked how she got the role. She told E! News about it in detail and said it occurred on a podcast she was a member of. According to the reality star:</p><p>“I was on a podcast when someone asked whether I knew there was going to be a reboot, and I didn’t. ‘Would you ever do it?’ they asked. And I said, ‘Sure.'”</p><p>The RHONY season 14 cast member also revealed what happened when she mentioned being on the show on the podcast. She claimed that someone created a mock-up of her using Photoshop software, which gave her the idea:</p><p>“And I suddenly thought, ‘Okay, maybe.’ ‘I mean, why not?’ And that all occurred by chance.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Jenna-Lyons-2.jpg alt="Jenna Lyons" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Jenna, on the other hand, didn’t provide too many specifics about the upcoming season, admitting that the women had begun filming, but it was in its early stages. Although she didn’t say much, the actress did say it’s been “very enjoyable” thus far.</p><p>The RHONY cast member also spoke about her time on the program. She stated:</p><p>“It’s really different from what I was expecting, which I believe is a good thing.”</p><p>When asked which new housewife was Andy Cohen’s favorite, she said that she hasn’t had any contact with the Bravo host since they first met. She looked certain, though, that it would be her.&nbsp;Jenna and her ex-husband, Vincent Mazeau, have a son called Beckett. She was married to her ex-artist sweetheart for nine years until they divorced in 2011. The RHONY actress then started dating Courtney Crangi, with whom she dated for six years until splitting in 2017.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGihnqaelnqtxc6nqmagkah6orrNqKynm5WZeqmx0WanpZmeqHq1u4yjpqKmXam1pnnCmqqtZZ%2BberO0zqewZquVlsCwuoxqa2g%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./4-ujbyglvhhanpsdx9axgmrwjza3kbf7.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Stream Movies, Shows &amp;amp; Live TV</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./bayern-munich-vs-psg-prediction-odds-betting-tips-and-tv-channel-for-friendly.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Bayern Munich vs PSG: Prediction, odds, betting tips, and TV channel for friendly</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-offensive-t-shirts-that-have-been-removed-from-stores.html>15 Most Offensive T-Shirts Ever</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./extreme-makeover-jillian-harris-edition.html>Extreme Makeover: Jillian Harris Edition!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lizzy-mcalpine-tour-2022-how-buy-tickets.html>Lizzy McAlpine tour 2022: How can I buy tickets?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nichole-lynel.html>Nichole Lynel</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./teddy-afro.html>Teddy Afro</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 LoopBlog.
