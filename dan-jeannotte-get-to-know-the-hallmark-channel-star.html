In the movie, he played a Parisian winemaker named Jacques who falls for an Oregon vintner named Isabella (<a href=#><strong>Jen Lilley</strong></a>) during a prestigious wine competition in France.</p><p>“I think a love story that takes place in Paris between a plucky young American winemaker and an old school French wine man kind of sells itself,” Jeannotte told <a href=#>TV Goodness in May 2019</a> of the story line. “I think it’s wonderful. It looks beautiful. It’s got a lot of spirit to it. It’s got a really cute story between two very likable leads. And there’s French accents, right?”</p><p>He joked that despite being a “casual wine drinker,” he was “willing” to <a href=#>learn more about the differences in wine</a> for his role.</p><p>“What’s funny is my go-to is Pinot Noir, which is what my character makes [in the movie],” the Royal Nanny star explained, noting he turned to a friend who is a sommelier for guidance. “You have to learn the vocabulary and train your palate. But it’s a training I am willing to do. I will put the time in.”</p><p>When it comes to Jeannotte’s first film of 2023 for Hallmark, he once again worked with food. In <a href=#>Sweeter Than Chocolate</a>, which premieres on Saturday, February 4, the actor plays a journalist named Dean Chase who is skeptical of chocolatier Lucy Sweet’s (<strong>Eloise Mumford</strong>) family’s magical sweet recipe.</p><p>“Anyone who eats one of the chocolate cupids is guaranteed to find their true love,” <a href=#>the January 2023 trailer</a> for the movie teased, hinting that the two leads may have “A bittersweet romance” or fall in “love at first bite.”</p><p>Jeanotte exclusively told Us Weekly in February 2023 that his character’s love life isn’t the only romance captured in the film.</p><p>“[We’re] seeing gay love stories, love stories with people who met later in life, older people who fell in love after having a marriage or losing a partner,” he said of the “diverse” side characters. “And it just goes to show there [are as] many different ways to fall in love as there are different people in the world.”</p><p>The Home for a Royal Heart actor also teased while his and Mumford’s characters have issues with one another in the film, the actors had an easy time working together. “Eloise and I got along famously. It was so good working together,” Jeannotte said. “We didn’t know each other beforehand, but we just kind of clicked immediately.”</p><p>In keeping with the <a href=#>“Loveuary” theme on Hallmark</a>, the network also released a special <a href=#>collection of chocolates</a> that fans can buy to eat while watching Sweeter Than Chocolate.</p><p>Plus, <a href=#>the book which inspired the film</a>, written by <strong>Lizzie Shane</strong>, is also available to purchase.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Sweeter Than Chocolate airs on Hallmark Channel Saturday, February 4, at 8 p.m. ET.</p><p>Scroll down to learn more about Jeannotte:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BZrq95yZ6Yp6afqcGmecaeq2asn2K4r7vWZquhnV2drq24zJqppGWTna6vusSlZKyskad8</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./dennis-waterman-passed-away-at-the-age-of-74.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Dennis Waterman Passed Away At The Age Of 74</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./angela-goethals.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Angela Goethals Biography</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-offensive-t-shirts-that-have-been-removed-from-stores.html>15 Most Offensive T-Shirts Ever</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./extreme-makeover-jillian-harris-edition.html>Extreme Makeover: Jillian Harris Edition!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lizzy-mcalpine-tour-2022-how-buy-tickets.html>Lizzy McAlpine tour 2022: How can I buy tickets?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nichole-lynel.html>Nichole Lynel</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./teddy-afro.html>Teddy Afro</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 LoopBlog.
