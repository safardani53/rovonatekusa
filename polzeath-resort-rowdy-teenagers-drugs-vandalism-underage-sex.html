Not me, that’s for sure.</p><p>“But if youngsters are having sex on the beach and they’re underage or they’ve been supplied <a href=#>alcohol</a> and drugs it could be unlawful.</p><p>“It’s uncomfortable to see. I’m a father and one time I saw a girl, who looked younger than 16, sat on top of a boy without her top on.</p><p>“We don’t want someone to get raped or a kid to fall off the cliff because they’re high on coke.”</p><p>Other <a href=#>TikTok</a> videos show a young boy walking around the beach asking girls to play “kiss or slap” and other young girls dance around while chanting, “I want to ride a Ranger”.</p><p>“The parents have no idea what their kids are doing,” continues Andy.</p><p>“An angry mum came to me the other day and was disgusted that her 14-year-old daughter had been offered ketamine, coke and cannabis on the beach.</p><p>She said they were never going to holiday here again.</p><p>“We know from our time in the police that the cocaine in <a href=#>Cornwall</a> has about eight per cent purity.</p><p>“So we don’t know what else they’re mixing it with.”</p><p>Drugs seem to be prevalent. Within five minutes of arriving in Polzeath I heard a group of teens in a pub boasting about cutting cocaine with their “Monzo card”.</p><p>“Henry”, who looked around 20, was talking so openly about his <a href=#>drug use</a> that he prompted a granny’s eyes on a nearby table to nearly pop out.</p><p>“I’ve already drunk eight pints of Rattler (Cornish cider),” Henry told me, as he invited me to their party.</p><p>A girl in the group, who looked about 17, said she would get her “t*ts out” to hitchhike home after their night out.</p><p>“If worse comes to worse I can just call Mummy and Daddy to pick us up,” replied Henry.</p><p>Adam Saunders, 23, a <a href=#>graduate</a> who works in a pizza restaurant on the beach, reckons the parents are to blame for their kids’ behaviour.</p><p>“Some of the kids are so entitled and rude,” he says.</p><p>“We are always clearing up smashed bottles in the morning.</p><p>“But their parents are to blame. They often drink-drive and swerve all over the road when they drop them off in their <a href=#>Range Rovers</a>.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/OW_FTRS_Polzeath_028jpg-JS833901121.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/RM_polzeath_beachJPG-JS831435621.jpg><p>His colleague Tatty, 21, adds: “It’s been so bad. The way the bottles are smashed is as if they’ve done it deliberately, rather than they’ve just dropped them.</p><p>“No one cares about them having a good time, just clear up after yourself.</p><p>“One night they’d only been there for about an hour and Andy had cleared up about eight bags of rubbish. There’s no respect.”</p><p>I quickly learn how muscular beach ranger Andy, who is 6ft 4in, has become a bit of a local heart-throb among the women.</p><p>A group of mums giggle like <a href=#>schoolgirls</a> as they tell me they wouldn’t mind getting “in trouble” on the beach so he can come and “rescue” them.</p><p>“Everyone thinks Andy’s a fitty,” says Tatty, laughing. “He’s built like a brick s**thouse but also really nice.”</p><p>When I ask Andy if he is aware of his fan club, he laughs and says: “I didn’t think people would be keen on an old-timer like me.</p><p>“There are much younger and fitter lifeguards around.</p><p>“There’s always been harmless flirting from women but I don’t want to mix business with pleasure while representing my employers and a community who trust me to get a job done.”</p><p>Andy and his team, including Charlie Marrow, a fellow ex-cop of 32 years who spent 18 years with <a href=#>The Met</a>, have seen great results from their crack down.</p><p>Andy says: “Because of the success we’ve had this year we’ve received calls from other seaside towns having similar problems asking us for help. It’s our 360-degrees approach.</p><p><strong>“</strong>Every night there’s two police officers patrolling the beach, along with us and the Surfside’s security officers. We all work as a team.”</p><p>When they’re not saving lives or stopping rowdy teenagers from trashing the beach, they’re busy solving other <a href=#>crimes</a>.</p><p>“My new flip-flops were nicked this week,” says Charlie with a laugh.</p><p>“And a few other people have had theirs stolen. It could have been somebody who mistook them for theirs, but because we captured them on CCTV we were able to retrieve them a few days later with a bit of detective work.”</p><p>Back on patrol, security guards Julian and Jez have confiscated dozens of fake IDs tonight.</p><p>“The italic signature is usually a big giveaway,” says Julian. “Who uses italic handwriting these days?”</p><p>But Polzeath’s protectors are in luck this evening.</p><p>The <a href=#>weather</a> has put paid to parties and the few stragglers left on the beach are quickly identified by the floodlights and escorted off.</p><p>“The busiest period for us is the first three weeks of July when the private schools break up,” explains Andy.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>“We are hopefully over the worst of it, but time will tell.”</p><p>For now, it’s Beach Rangers 1, Sloane Rangers 0.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZ4B0gZhpaG5noKS5u7HArZ9mqpWovLPAjKumsJypYsGmsc2anp6qo2Kxs8HGrGSvmZ6Zrq210qZkrqaUmr%2Bis8Rmqp6wXw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./how-to-get-a-reservation-at-the-lost-kitchen-maine-erin-french-postcards.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How to Get a Reservation at Erin French's The Lost Kitchen in Maine</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./charity-lawson-threatens-to-rip-rose-away-from-suitor-on-shocking-bachelorette-episode.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Charity Lawson Threatens to &amp;quot;Rip Rose&amp;quot; Away from Suitor on Shocking Bachelorette Episode</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-offensive-t-shirts-that-have-been-removed-from-stores.html>15 Most Offensive T-Shirts Ever</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./extreme-makeover-jillian-harris-edition.html>Extreme Makeover: Jillian Harris Edition!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lizzy-mcalpine-tour-2022-how-buy-tickets.html>Lizzy McAlpine tour 2022: How can I buy tickets?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nichole-lynel.html>Nichole Lynel</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./teddy-afro.html>Teddy Afro</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 LoopBlog.
