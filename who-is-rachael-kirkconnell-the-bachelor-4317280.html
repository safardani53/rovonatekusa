She caught <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Matt James</a>‘</strong>&nbsp;eye from the very beginning of the season, and he told her he was falling in love with her during their one-on-one date during week five. During fantasy suites week on March 8, Rachael had a bit of a freakout over Matt spending intimate time with two other women, but Matt gave her the assurance she needed to feel confident in their relationship.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>“Where I’m at with you is I’ve fallen in love with you,” Matt told Rachael on their final three date. “I’m head over heels for you. I’m completely in love with you.” Matt has not yet made this declaration to his other final woman,&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Michelle Young</strong></a>. Viewers will see which woman Matt chooses during the March 15 finale, which was filmed in the fall of 2020. In the months since, as the show has aired, Rachael has been at the center of a very public controversy.</p><h2><strong>What Did Rachael Kirkconnell Do That Was Racist?</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/rachael-kirkconnell-5-things-to-know-abc-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>Shortly after Rachael was announced as a cast member on season 25 of&nbsp;The Bachelor, a woman who said she had gone to high school with her posted a TikTok video with claims about Rachael. The woman accused Rachael of “bullying” her for dating Black guys when they were in school together. Then, another TikTok user uncovered alleged controversial posts that Rachael had ‘liked’ on Instagram.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>As Matt started falling hard for Rachael, more about her past continued to come to light. At the beginning of February, photos surfaced of Rachael attending an Old South-themed party while she was in college. The party glorified the state of the country during this time, when slavery was prevalent. On Feb. 11, Rachael <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>issued a statement</a> to apologize for her past actions, and took accountability for her “ignorance.”</p><h2><strong>What Did Chris Harrison Say About Rachael?</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/bachelor-5-things-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>Despite Rachael’s apology, the scandal still exploded due to&nbsp;The Bachelor host,&nbsp;<strong>Chris Harrison</strong>, weighing in on the situation. During an interview with former Bachelorette,&nbsp;<strong>Rachel Lindsay</strong>, Chris defended Rachael K.’s past actions. After receiving major backlash for his response, he posted an apology on Instagram. However, it was too little too late. Chris eventually revealed he would <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>be ‘stepping aside’</a> from the Bachelor franchise for the time being. He confirmed that he would not be hosting the season 25&nbsp;After the Final Rose special. His <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>future with the franchise</a> after that is unknown.</p><h2><strong>What Is Rachael’s Job?</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>Rachael is a 24-year-old Graphic Designer from Cumming, Georgia, which is a small town outside of Atlanta. She went to college close to home at Georgia College and graduated in 2019 with a Bachelor’s of Business Administration in Marketing. She was on the Dean’s List twice during her time at school.</p><h2><strong>Rachael Kirkconnell Has Never Been In Love — Until Now</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/bachelor-5-things-embed2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-8>Although Rachael is a “hopeless romantic,” she’d never been in love before coming on The Bachelor, according to her ABC bio. “Rachael is hoping that her love story will be something huge and life altering,” her bio reads. “She wants to look back at her life when she’s old and feel like she has made the absolute most out of every single day.” However, Rachael has said that she’s fallen in love with Matt and that she’s ready for an engagement.</p><h2><strong>Is Rachael Kirkconnell On Social Media?</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-9>Rachael’s Instagram feed is full of photos of herself in the ocean, on the sand, by the pool and sunbathing.
